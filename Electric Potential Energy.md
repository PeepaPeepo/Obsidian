[[Electric Potential Energy]], $U_{elec}$, of a charge at a specific position can be determined by computing how much work it took to get to that position.

$$\Delta U_{elec}=W$$

The previous expression states the difference of [[Electric Potential Energy]] is equal to [[Work]], where work is 

![[work]]
