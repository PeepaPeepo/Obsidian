![[Mechanism 19.1 Nucleophilic Addition Under Basic Conditions.png]]

In regards to [[Carbonyl Groups]] the carbon of the group is partially positive from the effects of [[Induction]]; that is a good candidate to attract the negatively charged [[Electrons]] of a [[Nucleophiles]].

The ketone is converted into an [[sp3-Hybridized Orbitals|sp3-Hybridized]] molecule with a negatively charged oxygen. 

[[Proton Transfers]] is done to clean up the negative charge and results with [[Hydroxyl Groups]].
