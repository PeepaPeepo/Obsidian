# Day 2

1. Carefully add ==3 M HCl== **drop wise** to solution, have ice bath on the side just in case
2. Use ==Stirring rod== to break up Pink and White Chunk of Precipitate, this should change it to a light muddy solution
3. Mount the flask and use auto stir for next few steps
4. Continue to add ==3 M HCl== until pH of aqueous layer is 2 - 3
5. Added more ==diethyl ether== to dissolve of the product
6. Remove spin vane and transfer yellowish solution to ==centrifuge tube== (The long skinny pointy vial)
7. **Reaction mixture should separate into two layers** as alkoxide salt dissolves
8. **Product is in upper diethyl layer (yellow)**  and the lower aqueous layer is clear
9. Remove lower aqueous layer with pipette to another clean centrifuge tube
10. (video) added ~1 mL portion of diethyl ether to aqueous solution
11. Wash ==aqueous layer with two 1 mL portions of diethyl ether, **Capped and gently swished**==
12. **24:21** Transferred **Something** from step 11
13. Combine all ==diethyl ether layers **(Combine the MAYBE THE TOP LAYER FROM STEP 11 with the yellow solution)**==, transfer to a centrifuge tube and wash with 1.0 mL of water
14. Remove lower aqueous layer and move to a **waste beaker**
15. Transfer the diethyl ether layer (yellow) to dry erlenmeyer flask and add anhydrous sodium sulfate (4 Regular Spatulas) for 10 minutes
16. Using Pasteur pipet transfer the dried solution to a ==25 mL Evaporating Flask==
17. Remove Diethyl ether by roto evaporation using air or drying line in fume off white solid which is a mixture of Triphenylmethanol and bihpenyl
18. Add ==2.0 mL Petroleum ether==, stir mixture througughyl and ==vacuum filter using a Hirshsch Funnel==.
19. Rinse the crystals of triphenylemthaonl with a small amount of petroleum ether.
20. Weigh product and calculate the percent yield for the reactions
