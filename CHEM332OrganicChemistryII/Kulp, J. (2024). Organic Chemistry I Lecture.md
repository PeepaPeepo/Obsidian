# 20241015 Chapter 6 Reaction Mechanisms

- Enthalpy is the exchange of heat between reaction and surroundings
- Electrons need to absorb energy to break bonds
- Types of bond breaks are homolytically and heterolytically
- Heterolytical bond cleavages are like acid base reactions and produces ions
- Homolytical bond cleavages distributes electrons and produces radicals
- energy values to break bonds increase from smaller atom to larger atom, may don't relate to EN? 
- Exothermic and Endothermic reactions where compare the starting materials and product ending area
- Bond breaking does not produce energy in respect to ATP, energy is produced when Phosphate forms a new bond
- Entropy shows molecules in their probably disorganized, but spends energy. Reactions that lead to greater amount of products is an increase of Entropy, S
- $\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S$ where G is negative is spontaneous
- Higher temperatures lead to higher $K_{eq}$ constants
- More Negative G values lead to Higher $K_{eq}$ constants
-  Kinetics and reactions rely on concentration of reactants, activation energy, temperature, geometry, and molecular orientation, presence of catalysts
- Reaction rates are determined by rate law where rate constant, k, is multiplied by reactants. Orders range from zero through third order
- Orders are found by by summing the exponents 
- Orders reflect the slowest step or rate determine
- Energy of activation, transition state, Reaction coordinate into an intermediate carbocation
- Rate constant, K, gives information about other variables such as temperature and orientation

- Think in terms of nucleophile and electrophile
- Think about Partial charge locations
- Additions as making the most stable carbocation
- Hydride shifts are easier
- Shifts can be any alkyl group 
- Hydrogens are easier to move cause of bond strength
- Review graphs
- Rearranged carbocations have different energy levels
- In a tie secondary cations determine what shifts are possible stable carbocations
- H going to 
- Racemic Mixtures include r and s, 
- Hyper conjugation and induction
- Formally charged C can induct
- Water present can act as a nucleophile
- Oxymercuration 
- ***Acid catylzed hydration, pi bond does not attack H2O but hydronium will be on exam***
- Dueterium can be used as tracker
- Working with most stable cation
- Hg-AcO attack, where Mercuary can create bridges
-
