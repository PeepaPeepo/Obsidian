# NMR: Complex Splitting Patterns

Geminal Positions means that protons are connected to the same carbon.
When splitting occurs with three adjacent protons of different environments are present.
Differentiation of the protons can be done by analyzing their J values.

# Rapid Exchange

Hydroxyl Protons give broad signals because it can disassociate.
Amines are more likely to couple than hydroxyl groups.
Relative positions on a rings include Ortho, meta, and para.
Ortho are adjacent to each other, meta is one a way from each other, and para is across from each other.
The position terminology mostly apply to aromatic rings.
Ortho has four unique protons in regards to nmr.
Signals of nmr can differentiate the positions of ortho, meta, and para.
Meta Position rings come out as singles because of the particular positionining

Consider lower ppm for complex splitting

NMR workflow goes for number of signals, chemical shifts, area of signal, and splitting pattern of each 
# Carbon 13 NMR Spectroscopy

Carbon 13 does not split because of its low abundance
Carbon nmr heigh is related to number of carbons 
Chemical shift is based on Resonances, it would shift it to the right
Do not use induction rules in this case
Shielding causes lower parts per million

# DEP T 13C NMR Spectroscopy/Overview

Confirms Carbons are methyl methylene or methine with a combination of different scans
Cross examine with plain c13 then dept 90 and 135

# 16.5 Thermodynamic vs Kinetic Control Adducts

- Kinetically Favored vs thermodynamically Favored 
- Stable Intermediate carbo cations tend to make kinetic products
- Unstable intermediate carbo cations tend to make thermo dynamic 
- Thermodynamic products are major most of the time
- Most stable product is the major product
- Think in terms of carbocat charge placements and degree of structures
	- Why not just the pick the higher degree carbo cat?
- Polymerization reactions are cases of 1,4 additions
- Cl Br or F 
- Chloroprene is like forever chemical

## Conjugating Pi Systems and Pericyclic Reactions

- Carbocations will aways shift to make the most stable structure
- Naming conventions is relative to the first H proton transfer

# 16.6 Intro to Pericyclic Reactions

- Pericyclic reations occur without ionic or free radicals
- Three main types include: Cycloaddition reactions, pericyclics and sigmatropic

## Pericyclic Reactions/Features

- Mechanism is concerted
- Ring of electrons moving around a closed loop
- Transition state is cyclic
- Polarity of solvent generally has no effect

# 16.7 Diels-Adler Reactions/Energy

- Dienophiles and Dienes 
- Dienophiles like dienes need to posses an electron withdrawing group, such taht imagine a pi bond with something electronegative attached
- Otherwise it would need more temp
- Electron withdrawing groups are typically spontaneous
- Diels Alder Reactions are stereospcific and depends on E or Z Dienophile, but the original positions are conserved

## Conformations

- Can be either s-cis or s-trans
- s-trans conformations do no react and require bond rotations

## 16.7 Stereospecificity

- Dienes with attached subsituents with high EN reacts faster
- Endo and Exo positions relative to rings
- Pi Stacking

==**Endo transition state** benefits from favorable interaterctions betweeen withdrawing groups and developing pi bonds==

**Exo transition state** does not have the favorable interaction
**Electron withdrawing groups** make reactions **spontaneous**
**Endo** looks axial
Pi bonds in rings force two positions to have similar layouts, think axial alternates, but bridges and pi bonds force it to be almost same identical positiosn
[[Dienes]] and [[Dienophiles]] are different, but have identical properties

## Regiochemistry

**One regiochemical outcome** means the reaction would take place in one area
If there is an unsymmetrical product, major and minor products can be formed
==Charges of dienophile determine the major product==
==Look at charges of resonance structures, and it can help deduce the most likely structure, the goal== is to find opposites that attact, and it can be done by rotating the dienophile to match up a positive to negative.
Endo products
**s trans reactants**
==Both reactants must be unsymmetrical to start working out which one position is best==
