# A Review of General Chemistry: Electrons, Bonds, and Molecular Properties 1

[[Chemical Reactions]] occur as a result of the motion of [[Electrons]]

## 1.1 Introduction to Organic Chemistry

[[Organic Compounds]] are derived from living organisms
[[Inorganic Compounds]] are derived from nonliving sources
Distinction fueled by different properties
[[Organic Compounds]] are hard to isolate as they decompose easier when heated
[[Vitalism]] thought that organic compounds had a vital force, but actually [[Friedrich Wohler]] demonstrated it was not
Ochem explains the ability to smell or see colors, or uses of clothing
Medicine, pesticides, paints etc are made from Ochem
Bodies are made of O compounds

## 1.2 Structural Theory of Matter

[[August Kekule]], Archibald Scott Couper, and Alexander M. Butlerov suggest that substances are defined by specific arrangement of atoms

Compounds can have same molecular formula but different in arrangement or connection

These are known as [[Constitutional Isomers]], which have different properties and names

Structural Theory of matter shows that elements can form predictable number of [[Covalent Bonds]] Carbon can form 4, [[Tetravalent]], [[Trivalent]], [[Bivalent]], and [[Monovalent]]

### 1.1 Drawing Constitutional Isomers of Small Molecules

Determine valency of each atom in the molecular formula
Atoms with the highest [[Valency]] are connected first

## 1.3 Electrons, Bonds, and Lewis Structures

### What are Bonds?

[[Covalent Bonds]] are the result of two [[Atoms]] sharing a[[Electrons]]
When electrons are shared, there is a decrease in energy noted as $\ce{ -\Delta H }$
Electrons are capable of moving in such a way to minimize repulsive forces

### Drawing the Lewis Structure of an Atom

[[Lewis Structures]] 
Number of [[Valence Electrons]] can be determine by the Group name the element is found
When filling electrons, they fill up unpaired to paired

### Drawing the Lewis Structure of a Small Molecule

[[Octet Rule]] states that atoms tend to bond to fill their valence shells
Nitrogen contains a [[Lone Pairs]]

1. Determine number of valence electrons
2. Connect any atoms that form more than one bond
3. Connect all hydrogen atoms 
4. Check if each atom has an octet

## 1.4 Identifying Formal Charges

[[Formal Charge]] is associated with any atom that does not exhibit the appropriate number of valence electrons

1. Determine appropriate number of valence electrons
2. Determine if atom exhibits the appropriate amount

When calculated, write charge to appropriate atom in the model

## 1.5 Induction and Polar Covalent Bonds

[[Electronegativity]] is calculated by the difference of electronegativity values of two bonded atoms

[[Covalent Bonds]] have values less than 0.5
[[Polar Covalent Bonds]] have values between 0.5 and 1.7
The withdrawal of electrons towards one element than another is called [[Induction]] and notated with with a cross above the originating atom and arrow towards the inducting atom
$\ce{ +-> }$
$\ce{ C-O }$

Partial charges are symbolized with $\ce{ \delta+ or \delta- }$

[[Ionic Bonds]] have differences higher than 1.7

### Electrostatic Potential Maps

[[Electrostatic Potential Maps]] visualize partial charges by colorizing models

## 1.6 Reading Bond-Line Structures

[[Bond-line structures]] were developed by organic chemists to simplify and speed up drawings of molecules.

### How to Read Bond-Line Structures

[[Bond-line structures]] are drawn in zigzags
Each corner or end point is a carbon atom
Double bonds are drawn with a extra parallel line
Triple bonds have separated triple parallel line that are linear because of its linear geometry
Hydrogen atoms that are bonded to carbon are shy'ed away 
Assumed that each carbon will saturate with the appropriate hydrogen
**

## 1.7 Atomic Orbitals

### Quantum Mechanics

[[Quantum Mechanics]] 
[[Wave Equation]] takes into account wavelike behavior of an electron
[[Wavefunctions]] $\ce{ \psi_{1} }$ corresponds to allowed energy level for electron
Energy of electrons are quantized

### Electron Density and Atomic Orbitals

[[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals|Orbitals]] regions of space where electrons can be occupied by electrons
[[Electron Density]] is the probability of finding an electron in a particular region of space
[[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals|Atomic Orbitals]] include s, p, d, f

### Phases of Atomic Orbitals

[[Nodes]]
$\ce{ \psi \ - or \ - + }$ does not imply charge of atom, but phase of wave

### Filling Atomic Orbitals with Electrons

Most organic compounds are composed momstly of H, C, N, and O
They occupy 1s, 2s, and 3 2p
Low shell equals low energy beceause closenss to nucleus and lack of nodes
Orbitals with same energy are called [[Degenerate Orbitals]]

[[Aufbau Principle]] states lowest energy orbitals are filled first
[[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] states that each orbital can have 2 electrons max with a spin (^ v)
[[Hund's Rule]] states taht electrons are placed in each [[Degenerate Orbitals]] in rounds before pairs

## 1.8 Valence Bond Theory

[[Covalent Bonds]] formed by overlap of [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals|Orbitals]]
[[Valence Bond Theory]] is the sharing of electron density between two atoms as a result of [[Constructive Interference]] of their orbitals
[[Molecular Orbital Theory]]

[[Constructive Interference]] produces a wave with larger [[Amplitude]]
[[Destructive Interference]] produces a node

[[Electron Density]] of $\ce{ H_{2} }$ is located on bond axis, and is called a [[Single Covalent Bonds|Sigma Covalent Bonds]], has circular symmetry 

## 1.9 Molecular Orbital Theory

[[Molecular Orbital Theory]] uses math to explore orbital overlap
[[Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals]] or LCAO
They are mathematically combined to form [[Molecular Orbitals]]
[[Molecular Orbitals]] are associated with an entire molecule as opposed to single atom

[[Bonding Molecular Orbital]] is a lower energy molecular MO from constructive interference
[[Antibonding Molecular Orbital]] is the result of destructive interference
[[Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital]] HOMO
[[Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital]] LUMO

## 1.10 Hybridized Atomic Orbitals

### Methane and $\ce{ sp^3 }$ Hybridization

[[sp3-Hybridized Orbitals]] are averaging of $\ce{ s }$ orbital and three $p$ orbitals.
The conventional electron configuration of carbon shows two valence electrons, but is known to be able to have 4 bonds.
Linus pauling suggested that 2s orbital and 2p orbitals can be hybridized to give four [[Degenerate Orbitals]]

### Double Bonds and $\ce{ sp^2 }$ Hybridization

Three [[sp2-Hybridized Orbitals]] occur in a carbon atom with one $p$.

p robitals overlap to form [[Double Covalent Bonds|Pi Covalent Bonds]] 

It seems like double bonds only occur with $\ce{ sp^2 }$ hybrid orbitals

### Triple Bonds and sp Hybridization 

overlap of sp orbitals make sigma pi bonds
REVIEW THIS SECTION

### Bond Strength and Bond Length 

Single bond has a sigma bond 
double bond has two bonding interactions of 1 sigma and 1 pi
triple bond has three bonding interactions one bond and two pi bonds 
## 1.11 Predicting Molecular Geometry VSPER Theory

[[Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory|VSEPR]] enables predictions about molecular geometry

### Tetrahedral Geometry

Methane $CH_{4}$ has four [[Sigma Bonds]] and no lone pairs
VSEPER theory presumes four electron pairs and forming a 
$sp^3$ hybridization typically forms [[Tetrahedral]] geometry

### Trigonal Pyramidal Geometry

Ammonia, $NH_{3}$, has three sigma bonds and one lone pair
Number of electron pairs is called the [[Steric Number]]
[[Steric Number]] is four in $NH_{3}$
A lone pair is positioned at one corner
lone pair occupies $sp^3$-hybridized orbital
Lone pairs can repel more than $\sigma$ bonds
[[Molecular Geometry]] in this case is [[Trigonal Pyramidal]]
[[Electron Geometry]] refers to the overall shape in addition to the molecule

### Bent Geometry

## 1.12 Dipole Moments and Molecular Polarity

[[Dipole Moments]], $\mu$, is indicator of polarity

$\mu=\delta*d$

Units of dipole moments are [[Debye]], $D$
Vector sum of multiple polar bonds are [[Molecular Dipole Moment]], it takes into account magnitude and direction of each dipole moment

Understand VSPER

4 will be tetrahedral electronic all the time, but can be different molecular shape

## 1.13 Intermolecular Forces and Physical Properties

[[Intermolecular Forces]] are electrostatic
[[Dipole Moments]] 
[[Hydrogen Bonds]]

### Dipole-Dipole Interactions

Compounds with net dipole moments can interact
Liquid phases have free movement but tend to attract each other molecules frequently

### Hydrogen Bonding

hydrogens bonded to an O, N, or F can create strong permanent dipoles
Hydrogen is small so the partial charges are very close
Hydrogen bonding gives high boiling points

### Fleeting Dipole-Dipole Moments

[[London Dispersion Forces]] are temporary dipoles that happen
Smaller surface areas lead to decrease in boiling point
Larger surface areas lead to increase boiling point

## 1.14 Solubility

# Chapter 3 Acids and Bases

[[Ionic reactions]] covers 95% of reactions in the textbook

## Do you remember?

- Identify formal carhges
- Drawing and Interpreting bond lines
- Identifying lone pairs
- Drawing resonance structures
## 3.1 Introduction to Bronsted-Lowry Acids and Bases

[[Brønsted Lowry Acid and Bases|Bronsted Lowry Acid and Bases]] is based on transfer of Proton $\ce{ H+ }$, bronsted acids donates protons and bases accept protons

Products of proton transfer reactions are [[Conjugate Bases]] and [[Conjugate Acids]]

## 3.2 Flow of Electron Density: Curved-Arrow Notation

Reactions happen via flow of electron density
Curved arrows are used as tools
[[Reaction Mechanisms]] show how reaction occurs in terms of motion of electrons
Mechanism of proton transfer reactions involves electrons from a base deprotonating an acid
Acids do not lose protons without bases
***Mechanism of a proton transfer always involves at least two curved arrows***
[[Reaction Mechanisms]] is the core of organic chemistry

### Drawing the Mechanisms of a Proton Transfer

Mechanism of proton transfer ***always*** involves two curved arrows
Tail of first arrow is a lone pair of the base pointing to proton
Tail of second arrow is the bonding electrons of the proton and adjacent atom, and points to the adjacent atom

Some cases, the involved proton is not shown due to bond line structure
Negative formal charge does not always indicate interacting lone pair, some cases don't have a negative charge involved. Neutral charged molecules may donate electrons to a positively charged molecule

## 3.3 Brontsted-Lowry Acidity: Comparing pK_a Values

Two ways to predict proton transfers: $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ value comparison and structure comparison

### Using $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ Values to Compare Acidity

General acid-base reaction is

$\ce{ HA+H_{2}O<=>A- + H_{3}O+ }$

[[Equilibrium]] occurs when there is no change in concentration of [[Reactants]] and [[Products]]
Forward reaction is equivalent to rate of reverse reaction
$\ce{ K_{eq} }$ is concentration of products over reactants, each is raised by their stoichiometric coefficients

$$\ce{ K_{eq} = \frac{[H_{3}O+][A-]}{[HA][H_{2}O]} }$$

$\ce{ K_{a} }$ is the equilibrium constant but for acids

$$K_{a} = K_{eq} [H2O] = \frac{[H3O+][A−]}{[HA]}$$

$K_{a}$ values measure strength of acids, strong acids have $\ce{ 10^10 }$
Weak acids can have up to $\ce{ 10^{-50} }$
Because the numbers are large, $pK_{a}$ was formed to make manageable numbers

$$\ce{ pK_{a} = -\log K_{a} }$$

Strong acids have low $pK_{a}$ values
Weak acids have high $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ values

Each unit represents an order of magnitude, pka of 10 is six orders of magnitude more acidic than pka of 16

### Skill Builder 3.2 Using $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ Values to Compare Acids

Look at $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ table and figure out what has the lower value to determine the stronger acid
Lower pKa is strong acid
High pKa is weak acid

Think pH scale, low pH is highly acidic

### Skill Builder 3.3 Using $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ Values to Compare Basicity

1. Draw conjugate acid of each base
2. Compare $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ values 
3. Identify the stronger base

Stronger acids ***always*** generates the weaker base
Bases with weak acids are strong bases

### Using $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ Values to Predict the Position of Equilibrium

Equilibrium ***always*** favors the formation of weak acid
Reverse process is negligible and not reversable

### Skill Builder 3.4 Using $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ Values to Predict Position of Equilibrium

1. Identify the acid on each side
2. Compare $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ values

Higher $\ce{ pK_{a} }$ values are the favored side

## Chemical Bonding Atomic Orbitals

[[Molecular Orbital Theory]] uses linear combination of the atomic orbitals to produce new molecular orbitals, They are not isolated to single atoms, but cover the molecule
[[Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital]]
	Typically Sigma Bond
[[Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital]]
	Vacant Antibonding spaces are commly LUMOS
[[Valence Bond Theory]] sates that uses valence electrons on each atom to form covalent bonds
[[Hybridization]]
[[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals|Orbitals]]
In phase is the same thing as [[Constructive Interference]]
Out of phase is [[Destructive Interference]]
[[Sigma Bonds]] is different from a single bond, it will produce the single bond but has different characteristics
	[[Anti Bonding]]
		Caused by destructive interference 
	[[Sigma Bonds]]
		Caused by constructive interference
		**Electrons directly face each other**
$\ce{ \sigma }$* High energy
$\ce{ \sigma }$ Low Energy
This would be most useful in regards to [[Resonance Structures]]

[[sp3-Hybridized Orbitals]] moves 2s to an additional p degenerate orbital with a counter spin, affiliated with tetrahedral shapes. It forms $\ce{ sp^3 }$ orbitals: _ _ _ _
[[sp2-Hybridized Orbitals]]  have three bonded groups, two of the 2p orbitals make 3 sp2's with a 2s
Unhybridized 2p helps form double bonds
Makes a Trigonal geometric shape

[[sp-Hybridized Orbitals]]
Hydrogen never hybridized
$\ce{ C-H(\sigma) }$
$\ce{ sp^3 + 1s }$ 

$\ce{ C-C(\sigma) }$
$\ce{ sp^3 + sp^3 }$

[[Pi Bonds]] 
[[Sigma Bonds]] directly touched, always uses the hybridized orbtials
Sigma Pi bonds have the 2p orbital in 
sp2 hybridized orbital such that they come from "-z and +z" poles
Double bonds are stronger than single, but not doubled the strength

# Chapter 6 Chemical Reactivity and Mechanisms 

234. Electrons in bonding molecular orbital are in a lower energy state
234. Those electrons must get enough energy to get out and break the bond via Heat or Enthalpy
234. Enthalpy is determined by amount of energy to break a bond Homolytically
234. Homolytical bond cleavage leads to two radicals each of which have unpair electrons
234. Heterolytic bond cleavages result in two ions
235. Energy to break via homolytic bond cleavage is bond dissociation energy
235. The net total of heat change is called Heat of Reaction
235. The sign of the heat of reaction determines direction of heat transfer
235. Exothermic reactions are - and gives energy to the surroundings
235. endothermic is positive and it takes energy
235. Reaction coordinates can help identify the direction of signs
235. Physicists think of $\Delta H^o$ in terms of surrounding than system, so if the heat of the system is going to the surrounding, it is leaving the system.
235. $+\Delta H = H_{surr} \to H_{sys}$
235. $-\Delta H = H_{surr} \leftarrow H_{sys}$
235. The system IS the reaction
237. Predicting $\Delta H^o$ requires counting of broken and formed bonds, summing their respective literature values of kJ/mol
238. Entropy is measure of what the substance would most likely be in the setting
239. Spontaneous processes occur with entropy
240. Entropy is $\Delta S$
241. One if the initial mole of reactant changes to greater moles of product then this is an example of an increase of entropy
242. With more moles of a substance, the more possibilities of arranging them
243. Entropy does not always mean more substance, if there is a conversion of cyclic compound to acyclic, entropy increase from possible confirmations
244. The larger number of states or positions equate to larger entropy
245. Thinking of net entropy and the relationships with system and surrounding
246. The measure of Change of entropy of surrounding is equal to the negative heat of a system divided by kelvin $\ce{ \Delta S_{surr}=-\frac{\Delta H_{sys}}{T} }$
247. Gibbs free energy is equal to -K times Total entropy of the universe
248. $\Delta H$ can be estimated by analyzing amount of bonds broken and built
249. Review 6.1 better
250. Negative G = exergonic, Positive G is endergonic

# 14 Infrared Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry

## 14.1 Introduction to Spectroscopy

### The Nature of Light

- Electromagnetic Radiation, also known as light, can be interpreted as light or waves
- Wave lengths are the distance between peaks in a wave
- Frequency is how often wavelengths pass through a specific point over time
- Frequency and wavelengths are inversely proportionate
- When viewing light as particles, photos are packets of energy
- Electromagnetic frequency is divided into multiple ranges in the Electromagnetic Spectrum

### The Nature of Matter

- Matter also shows properties like waves and particles
- Molecules can store energy in multiple ways, but only in specific quantized levels

### The Interaction between Light and Matter

- Photons of light can be absorbed into bonds, and when there is enough energy is promotes a Vibrational Excitation
- Molecules and Infrared radiation promotes excitations of the bonds in a molecule 

## 14.2 IR Spectroscopy

### Vibrational Excitation

- Vibrational excitation in bonds can occur in multiple ways such as stretching or bending.

### Identification of Functional Groups with IR Spectroscopy

- Almost every bond can absorb IR radiation, and functional groups have unique characteristic frequencies

### IR Spectrometer

- IR Spectrometer irradiates frequencies of IR radiation into a sample, and the pass through frequencies are detected
- Fourier transform (FT-IR) spectrometer shoots all frequencies then uses a math operation called Fourier transform 
- Preparing samples require salt plates because they are transparent, the liquids can be sandwiched in between. It has to be a liquid state, otherwise it is pressed into a KBr pellet
- Soluble materials can be mixed with a solvent to go in the salt plates
- Liquid samples are neat samples

### General Shape of an IR Absorbance Spectrum

- IR Spectrometers measure the percent transmittance of a function of frequency
- The plot is called an absorption spectrum 
- Spikes on a plot are called absorption bands
- Locations of absorption bands are reported in wave numbers 
- Wave numbers are inverse centimeters to make it proportional to energy
- Signals in IR spectrum are characterized by wavenumber, intensity, and shape

## 14.3 Signal Characteristics: Wavenumber 

### Hooke's Law

- wavenumber of absorption of stretched bonds are based on bond strength and masses of atoms 
- smaller atoms give bonds that vibrate at higher frequencies, which also means higher energy and higher wave number of absorption
- Consider the difference between masses of C and H
- Bonds to H is easier to shake than non H atoms
- IR Spectra is divided in to diagnostic regions and fingerprint regions
- Finger print regions are cluttered, but still unique to compounds
- Key Landmark wavenumbers $cm^{-1}$ are 1600 and 2700
- or 1500 and 3000
### Effect of Hybridization States on Wavenumber of Absorption

- $sp_{3}$ is produce weaker bonds than $sp$ 
- $sp$ orbitals are most similar to $s$ orbitals and results with electrons very close to the nucleus of an atom
- Short bonds are stronger 
- Tetrasubstitued double bonds do not posses any $\ce{C_{sp^2} \bond{-}H}$ 
- Internal triple bonds do not posse $\ce{ C_{sp} - H }$
- Any shift from sp3 towards sp is a shift to the left
- $\ce{ C-H }$ bonds are typically found right below 3000, then each hybrid change shifts it to the left
- 
### Effect of Resonance on Wavenumber of Absorption 

- Unsaturated, conjugated ketone is formed because the presence of a C pi C bond doesn't saturate all carbons with H. Conjugation occurs from the space of the the two pi bonds
- More Resonance structures lead to weaker wave numbers because they start to show more single bond characteristics rather than double

## 14.4 Signal Characteristics: Intensity

- Strength of Dipole moments change when bonds vibrate
- Dipole moments are electric fields that surround the bond, which absorbs IR radiation
- Carbonyl groups produce the strongest signals in IR spectrum
- $\ce{ C-H }$ bonds are frequent that their signals stack and appear strong as one unit

### 14.5 Signal Characteristic: Shape

- Signals can be spiky or rounded

### Effects of Hydrogen Bonding

- Hydrogen bonding weakens existing $\ce{ O-H }$ bonding in alcohols
- OH bonds do not have consistent bond strengths and is known as distribution of bond strengths
- Molecules that do no participate in H bonding result in strong spiky absorption bands
- Carboxylic acids produce broad signals that overlap with C-H signals

### Amines: Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical Stretching

- $\ce{ N-H }$ bonds can be stretching either in a Symmetric or Asymmetric Stretching fashion

## 14.6 Analyzing an IR Spectrum

- When Analyzing an IR Spectrum start with a line at 1500 $\ce{cm^{-1}}$ then focus the left side, which is the diagnostic region
- Double bonds appear around 1600-1850
- Triple bonds appear around 2100-2300
- Z-H Bonds appear around 2700 - 4000
- Carbonyl groups are very prominent around 1700 cm
- Amides have lower frequency absorption

## 14.7 Using IR Spectroscopy to Distinguish between Two Compounds

- IR Spec is used to differentiate two compounds and checking of a reaction transformed a group to another one
- For example, if a reaction was expected to get rid of $\ce{ -OH }$ groups, check if the broad signal is in the product

## 14.8 Introduction to Mass Spectrometry

- Electron Impact Ionization generates radicals and cations
- Radical Cation, $\ce{ (M)^{+.} }$, is the Molecular Ion or Parent Ion
- Molecular Ions are prone to getting fragmented again where one or the other gets the charge leaving a cation
- Cations are separated by mass-to-charge ratio, ${ m/z}$,
- The tallest peak in a mass spectrum is the Base Peak, molecular ions are not always the base peak
- $z$ is the charge of an ion, and typically is +1. $m / z$ is basically mass, $m$, per cation

## 14.9 Analyzing the $\ce{ (M)^{+.} }$ Peak

-  When analyzing mass spectrum , look for the $\ce{ (M)^{+.} }$ peak which indicates the Molecular Weight of the molecule
- Mass Spectrum ion peak should show up around the Molecular Weight of the Molecule
- Nitrogen Rule indicates that Odd number molecular weight means odd number of nitrogen atoms, or even numbers lead to even numbers of nitrogen atoms

## 14.10 Analyzing the $\ce{ (M +1)^{+.} }$ Peak

- $\ce{ ^12C }$ makes up the peak at $\ce{ (M +1)^{+.} }$
- The peak is about 1.1% as tall as the M Peak

## 14.12 Analyzing the Fragments

- Most of the peaks are produced from further fragmentation of molecular ions
- The fragments themselves are not enough to determine the structure of the molecule

### Fragmentation of Alkanes

- Fragmentation will occur in every possible location but will favor making stable Carbocations
- The peak is M minus the molecular weight of the radical produced

### Fragmentation of Alcohols

- Alcohols do not show molecular ion peaks because they fragment easily
- They produce two specific patterns, alpha cleavage and dehydration
- Alpha cleavage typically results in a resonance stabilized cation
- Dehydration leads to a peak M minus the MW of water, 18

### Fragmentation of Amines

## 15.1 Introduction to NMR Spectroscopy

- Two common types of NMR: $\ce{ ^1H }$ and $\ce{ ^{13}C }$ NMR Spectroscopy
- Only Nuclei with Odd number of protons can spin and be detected by NMR
- The spin of the proton makes a Magnetic Moment
- Protons can align either in $\alpha$ or $\beta$ spin states, aligned or against the field
- Nuclei in $\alpha$ spin state can be flipped to $\beta$ spin state and enter a resonance
- When a nucleus is exposed to an external magnetic field, it can produced a local induced field
- The effect is diamagnetism
- Proton is subjected to two fields, the local and external. The net magnetic field strength is smaller than the external which is considered shielded
- Any proton that has less electron density is deshielded

## 15.2 Acquiring a $\ce{ ^1H }$ NMR Spectrum

### Magnetic Field Strength

- Magnetic Field Strength establishes the energy gap between spin states

## 15.3 Characteristics of $\ce{ ^1H }$ NMR Spectrum

- Location indicates the electronic environment of protons that make a signal
- Area underneath each signal is the number of protons that make up the signal
- Shape indicates the number of neighboring protons

## 15.4 Number of Signals

### Chemical Equivalence

- Protons in the same environment are chemically equivalent
- Protons that are interchangeable by rotation, they are Homotopic
- If protons are interchangeable by plane of symmetry, they are Enantiotopic 
- If the protons are not interchangeable, they are not chemically equivalent and have another of their own signal

- Three Protons in a methyl are equivalent
- $\ce{ CH_{2} }$ groups are usually chemically equivalent when there are not chiral centers
- $\ce{ CH_{2} }$ groups are equivalent if they are as a whole homotopic (interchangeable via rotation)

## 15.5 Chemical Shift

### Chemical Shift Values

- Chemical shift is the position in the NMR Spectrum where left side is downfield and other is upfield
- Deshielded protons are more Downfield DD
- Shielded protons are upfield
- Downfield signals require more absorb higher frequencies of radiation

### Inductive Effects

- Electronegative Atoms withdraw electrons from neighboring atoms, which take away electrons and make the methyl group deshielded
- Deshielded = Downfield = Higher ppm
- Shift is relative to electronegativity of the halogen where F is the greatest and down the column is weakest (I)
- Stacking Halogens increase the shift
- Easier way to interpret is that F = 4 ppm shift, then down by 1ppm each element
- Induction greatly affects alpha positions, gamma positions are not really affected
- Benchmark values are Methyl (0.9 ppm), Methylene (1.2 ppm), Methine (1.7 ppm)

### Anisotropic Effects

- Benzene Rings can experience anisotropic effects
- Benzene Rings Make signals around 7 ppm

## 15.7 Multiplicity

- Coupling occurs when a proton is within three bonds of another
- The signal that shows from coupling is based on N+1 rule where N is number of neighbors, then the sum of the rule is equal to the number of peaks 

### Pattern Recognition

- Isolated groups have characteristic patterns

### Complex Splitting

- If a proton has two different neighboring protons then a complex splitting pattern can arise

![[Pasted image 20250217194346.png]]

- Take the multiplicities based on the surrounding neighbors, $H_{a}$ is doublet (2), and $H_{b}$ is Triplet
- The product is a doublet of Triplets, but only because the j-value for ab was much greater than bc

![[Pasted image 20250217194724.png]]

- In the chase where J values are similar, you can just count the neighbors and itll go as expected
- Multiplets occur when the difference in J Values are in the middle of large or similar difference
- Complex splitting can commonly occur with alkenes

# 16 Conjugated Pi Systems and Pericyclic Reactions

## 16.1 Classes of Dienes

[[Dienes]] are any compounds that have two $\ce{ C=C }$ bonds, and can have three classifications: [[Cumulated Dienes]], [[Conjugated Dienes]], [[Isolated Dienes]].
[[Cumulated Dienes]] are two adjacent pi bonds
[[Conjugated Dienes]] are alternating bonds
[[Isolated Dienes]] have pi bonds that are too far from each other

*Classification of Dienes*
![[Pasted image 20250225120014.png]]

Conjugation does not have to be exclusive to $\ce{ C=C }$ bonds, as long as they resonate it can work.

## 16.2 Conjugated Dienes

### Preparation

[[Conjugated Dienes]] are produced from allylic halides and elimination reactions, specificially with big bulk bases to prevent other SN2 Reactions

### Stability

Resonance decreases the required Heats of hydrogenation because pi bonds that resonate are technically not 2 full pie bonds etc.

### Conformation of 1,3 Butadienes

**s-cis** and **s-trans** conformation refers to rotational conformation of a conjugated diene, are they on the same cis side? position in trans?

**s-trans** is thermodynamically favorable compared to s-cis.
Most of the time s trans confirmation is a very common conformation, like 98% of the time.

## 16.3 Molecular Orbital Theory

## 16.4 Electrophilic Addition

### Addition of HX across 1,3-Butadiene

[[Markovnikov Addition]] installs halogens at more substituted position, but also just favors the area that produces the most stable [[Carbocations]].

[[Butadiene]] when treated with HBr has two outcomes, evading the idea that major product might be just one type. The book eludes to the idea that during carbocation occurrence, the conjugation of pi bonds allow for resonance structures. This suggests that because they aren't really two full bonds, but a shared molecular orbital. This allows for leaving groups or nucleophiles to have an equal change to attack either positions.

Compounds can either be [[1,2-Addition]] and [[1,4-addition]], it's based on the relationship between the initially connected hydrogen and the final br.

Products are formally called [[1,2-Adduct]] and [[1,4-Adduct]]

Keep in mind, although it is ideal to make the 'best structures' by starting steps with best stable carbocation, conjugated structures have equal chances to produce structures from stable and unstable carbo cations.
## 16.5 Thermodynamic Control vs. Kinetic Control

Ratio of [[1,4-Adduct]] and [[1,2-Adduct]] depends on the temperature that the reaction occurs at, consider that stable products take more heat to make vs kinetic adducts.

More substituted double bonds result in lower energy. The activation of energy to do so takes a lot of work.

 Book says proximity effect determines kinetic and thermodynamic control.
 Stable Adducts, where double bond is more substituted are thermodynamically favorable. Think it takes more work to make thermodynamic products.

### Key Concepts

Kinetic Products are major at lower temperatures and are the least substituted pi bond.
Thermodynamic Products are major at higher temperatures and are the most substituted pi bond.
When considering the possible products of dienes, the resonance structures are of even probability of occurring because of the conjugation characteristic. 

Less stable adducts are less substituted and takes less work and therefore 'faster' to make.

## 16.6 An Introduction to Pericyclic Reactions

[[Pericyclic Reactions]] ==do not involve ionic or radical intermediates?==, and three major groups include [[Cycloaddition Reactions]], [[Electrocyclic Reactions]], and [[Sigmatropic Rearrangements]].

![[Pasted image 20250226164527.png]]

Key Features of [[Pericyclic Reactions]] are reactions mechanisms are concerted, involves a ring of electrons in a closed loop, occurs in a cyclic transition state, polarity of the solvent of reaction has little effect.

Types of reactions depended on number of bonds broken and formed. Cycloaddition loses and gains by 2, and electrocyclic is 1.

## 16.7 Diels-Adler Reactions

###  The Mechanism of a Diels-Adler Reaction

Diels-Alder Reaction is called a [[4+2 Cycloaddition]] because it takes place between two different $\pi$ systems, one has four atoms and the other has 2. This results in a cyclo**hexene** and not hexane.

### Thermodynamic Considerations

Higher temperatures can reverse [[4+2 Cycloaddition]] and is known as [[Retro Diels-Alder Reaction]]

### The Dienophile

[[Dienes]] and [[Dienophiles]] that can make [[Retro Diels-Alder Reaction]] happen.
A plain diene, like $\ce{ C=C }$ can react with [[Conjugated Dienes]], but very slowly. The rate can increase if there's an attached electron withdrawing group. In this context the group needs to resonate, so conjugated pi bonds are the key.

![[Pasted image 20250226171254.png]]

The configuration of 1,2 subbed alkenes are maintained when forming a ring, so if the alkene was a cis configuration, it will be cis on the ring.

Triple bonds can act as dienophiles and it results with a ring with two double bonds.

### The Diene

[[Diels-Alder Reactions]] only work when [[Dienes]] are in s-cis conformation. Rings that have an permanent s-trans diene present will not react. It is hard to see, but its there.

![[Pasted image 20250226192546.png]]

Some rings have permanent s-cis conformations that react very fast in diels adler reactions.

[[Cyclopentadiene]] is so reactive in Diels Alder Reactions that it can react with itself and form dimer

### Endo Preference 

[[Cyclopentadiene]] is the diene that leads to endo and exo positions of substituents. The book describes that endo position is cis to the pi bond bridge, and exo is cis to the single bond bridge head.

This can be interpreted as when the structure is drawn as a 'chair' endo is the bottom, and exo is the top.

Endo position of the cycloadduct is the preferred position, and probably the most exclusive.
End position is set up when the cis dienophile is 'facing towards' the cyclopentadiene so that the p orbitals or orbitals of inductive atoms are overlapping with the cyclopentadiene.

### Regioselectivity of Diels-Alder Reactions

If the reagents of a [[Diels-Alder Reactions]] are both asymmetrical, the resonance structures and potential locations of charges determine confirmation and positions of substituents. 

The diene resonates in a way that the oxygen pushes the lone pair so one of the terminal ends of the diene get a negative charge. The pi bond cant really resonate anyway else. For the dienophile the most reasonable structure pushes a negative charge on to oxygen, and leaves the positive on the terminal end. 

Think of how opposites attract, then rotate the molecule to make them react. When the reaction mechanism is drawn, the 'non' resonated structures are used (the neutral charged structures)

# 17 Introduction to Aromatic Compounds

## 17.1 Aromatic Compounds

[[Aromatic]] or [[Aromatic|Arene]] originally derived from fragant oils
Most compounds are odorless
Conjugation in arenes flow in circles vs chains where its back and fourth
Polyarhomatic Compounds, affiliated with smoked foods
Aromatic rings tend to be carcinogen

## 17.2 Nomenclature of Benzene Deriv.

Benzene is generally the parent name for monosubstituted derivatives
Bezenes can be represented as Ph or Phi symbol $\phi$
Common names for dimethyl benzne is xylene
Ortho, meta, and para are positional names
ortho 1,2
meta 1, 3
para 1, 4

Para has one 1H signal when symmetrical 
Electron charges can be labelled as ortho, meta, and para
consider resonance structures and how lone pairs can interact with electronegative 
Ortho and meta have simialr resonance structures, but in meta substituents do no have the capacity to withdraw because the resonated lone pairs are never on the same carbon

## 17.3 Structure of Benzene

Benzene does not have double bonds because of resonance, more like a 1 1/2 bond

## 17.4 Stability of Benzene

Benzenes are stable and doesn't react easily
Halogenation Bridges
Experimentally determined that heat of hydrogenation shows that third double bond does not match trend
**Not all fully conjugateds rings are enough to have aromatic stability**
Criteria includes: 
1. Fully conjugated ring with overlapping p orbitals
2. [[Hükel's Rule]]: Odd number of e- pairs or 4n+2 total pi electrons

[[Antiaromatic]] molecules are missing a closed shell electron configuration are much less stable than aromatic

Tub-shaped confomations can avoid being antiaromatic, becomes nonaromatic 
Nonaromatic conditions make double bonds actually liek double bonds
[[Frost Circles]] predict shapes and energies of molecular orbitals
1. Draw circle
2. Draw ring in question with a point at the bottom tangent to circle
3. bisect the hash lines horizontally to find antibonding mo's
Frost circles explains the 4n+2 rule

## 17.5 Other Aromatic Compounds

### Aromatic Heterocycles

## 17.6 Reactions at Benzylic Position

Carbons that are connected directly to a benzene ring is called a [[Benzylic Position]]
[[Chromic Acid]] does not readily react with [[Benzene]] or [[Alkanes]], but it does very well with [[Benzylic Position]]
If [[Benzylic Position]] is [[Quaternary]], then it doesn't react.
[[Benzylic Position]] can be oxidized with other reagents like [[Potassium Permanganate]]
[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] of a [[Benzene]] with an existing non quaternary [[Benzylic Position]] will produce a [[Benzoic Acid]]

## 18.1 Introduction to Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution

[[Benzene]] is a stable molecule and is typically inert in the context of addition reactions.
When Fe (iron) is present in the mixture, benzene can react and ends up with a singly added Br. 
This is technically not a addition reaction, but classified as its own [[Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution]] where an aromatic proton is replaced with an [[Electrophile]].

### Questions

Why is [[Benzene]] considered inert in the context of Addition Reactions?
Does [[Benzene]] easily react with Halogens such as $Br_{2}$? 
What element can alter the behavior of [[Benzene]]?
What is [[Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution]]?

### Summary

[[Benzene]], a six membered hydrocarbon ring with [[Conjugation]] present, is a molecule that doesn't readily react with halogens such as $Br_{2}$. When Fe is introduced, an [[Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution]] can occur where one of the [[Aromatic Protons]] are replaced with the [[Electrophile]].

## 18.2 Halogenation

[[Diatomic Elements]] such as $Br_{2}$ can function as a [[Electrophile]] when they are close to [[Nucleophiles]] such as a $\pi$ bond, the bi bond allows for temporary polarization to let it react.
This isn't strong enough to occur when working with [[Benzene]].
The presence of iron increases the electrophilicity of bromine because Fe reacts with Br2 to make Tribromide which is a better form to react with ben
