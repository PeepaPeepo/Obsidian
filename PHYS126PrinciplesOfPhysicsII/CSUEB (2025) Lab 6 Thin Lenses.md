Lab topics include using ray diagrams to determine image location, and learn about real and virtual lenses.

# Background

Converging lenses converge rays to a specific point.

# Experiment 1.

*identifying Lenses*
Hold lens directly under ceiling light
Not distance from lens to floor when image becomes sharp
Figure out focal lengths of each lens by finding image distance, $s'$

## Experiment 2.

Testing someone else's hypothesis
Plot of s vs s'
Student says this linearly related

Prove if the linear relationship is true for converging lens for any s and s'

1. Describe experiment that will prove that
2. Make quantitative prediction of outcome of experiment
3. Perform experiment and record into excel spreadsheet
4. Evaluate uncertainties in measurement 
5. Represent uncertainties on the graph error

# Experiment 3. 

Building optical setup that creates
