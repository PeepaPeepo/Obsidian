- Index of refraction depends on frequency of light
- Double rainbows have a secondary rainbow that results from the concept that light transmit and partially reflects when passing through a medium

$$\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}=\frac{\sin \theta_{1}}{\sin\theta_{2}}=\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}=\frac{\lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{2}}$$

- To find the distance between to rays from dispersion, find their respective angles then do soh cah toa to find their distances

## Chapter 20 - Electric Fields and Forces

- Gravitational fields are everywhere
- Electrons keep matter apart
- Force depends on distance between objects
- Charges are based on the transfer of electrons
- Rubbing a plastic rod with a material can led to transfer of electrons, then each material would either be net positive or net negatively charged
- Ground would typically take charges of everything
- Metals conduct charges well but hold them poorly
- There is always attraction between charged and neutral objects
- Majority of water droplets would be attracted to the balloon 
- Charges on a insulator do not move

[[Voltage]] is the si unit for [[Electric Potential]]
[[Electric Potential]] is basically like a spring loaded mechanism, two like charges in close proximity has the ability to do work.

==**Parallel Plate Problems**==
==**Comparing Potential Energies relative to a charge**==
==**Review Circuit Notation**==

==[[Law of Conservation of Energy]] where $E=K_{1}+U_{1}=K_{2}+U_{2}$==
[[Electron Volt]] is electron times volt
Mass of proton/electon in kg

Epsilon $\epsilon$

$$U_{elec}=K\frac{qq'}{r}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}} \frac{qq'}{r}$$
$$V=K \frac{q}{r}$$
[[Electric Potential]], outside a sphere of charge Q is the potential has teh same form as for a point charge Q with all the stiting at the center

If the sphere has radius R and the potential and its surface is V0 then the potential a distance r from its center can also be written
