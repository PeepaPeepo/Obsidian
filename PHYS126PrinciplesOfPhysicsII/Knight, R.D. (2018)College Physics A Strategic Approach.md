# Part V: Optics

## 17 Wave Optics

### 17.1 What is Light?

#### The Propagation of Light Waves

- Diffraction is the spread of a wave when it passes through a window like opening of a barrier, this can include slits that light can pass through.
- Diffraction only becomes prominent when the opening of the barrier is of similar size of the wavelength of the wave.

#### Light is an Electromagnetic Wave

- Light is a disturbance of electromagnetic fields
- The Speed of Light is defined as the following, note that it is the same speed of all electromagnetic waves such as UV or visible light

$$v_{light} = c = 3.00*10^8 m/s$$
- Wavelengths of light are small, like nanometers small.

#### The Index of Refraction

- Light slows down when traveling through other transparent materials
- Speed of light in a particular material is known as the index of refraction

$$n=\frac{c_{vac}}{c_{mat}}=\frac{c}{v}$$

- A vacuum has index, n, of 1.
- Frequency of wave does not change when passing through different material
- Wavelengths in materials are shorter than when in air

### 17.2 The Interference of Light 

#### Young's Double Slit Experiment

- Interference of light needs two sources, so a double slit can make that happen
- Like the earlier mention of diffraction, since the slits are of smaller size they allow the light to diffract pass the openings cause them to spread out.
- Dark bands on the screen are called Interference Fringes, and the bright fringes are numbered by integer m = 1, 2, 3
- The brightest fringe is the Central Maximum

#### Analyzing Double-Slit Interference

- The spacing between two slits is $d$
- The distance between the slits and the viewing screen is $L$ assuming that the distance is much greater than the two slits
- When a path length distance equals a whole number, it produces a bright fringe
- A point, $P$, can be a either distance from the from the viewing screen $y_{m}$ or an angle $\theta$
- The distance is so great it can be generalized as $\Delta r=d\sin \theta$

## 18 Ray Optics

### 18.1 The Ray Model of Light

- A Light Ray is a line where light energy is flowing as opposed to a light wave.
- Laser beams are a good representation of a light ray and its properties
- The Ray Model of Light have the following properties: Light rays are straight lines, that can cross, travel indefinitely until something stops it, objects are sources of these rays, and the eye focuses on a bundle of rays.
- Light rays move at the speed of light
- When light rays cross they do not affect each other
- Light can either be scattered or absorbed
- Objects can be a source of rays from every point on it, the rays are sent in every possible direction
- Types of objects can be self luminous or reflective

#### Sources of Light Rays

- Self Luminous Objects create light and examples are the sun or light bulbs
- Reflective Objects reflect light from Self Luminous Objects
- The types of self luminous objects are ray sources, point sources, extended sources, and parallel ray sources.

#### Ray Diagrams

- Rays come from every point of an object
- Ray Diagrams show few rays
- Objects that reflect incident light in every direction is called Diffuse Reflection
- Each ray that reflects of an object is scattered in a process called Scattering

### 18.2 Reflection

- Smooth boundaries make Specular Reflections, examples include mirrors
- Angle of Incidence is angle between incident ray and the normal of the surface
- The reflected ray has the same exact angle, called angle of reflection

#### The Plane Mirror

- Flat mirrors are called Plane Mirrors
- All reflected rays appear to be coming from $P'$, the Virtual Image of P
- The main concept is that the reflection LOOKS like its coming from there, like behind the mirror, but its not. 
- $P'$ is pronounced "P" Prime
- Image distance is equal to object distance

### 18.3 Refraction

- When Light passes into some transparent objects, some of it is reflected or refracted based on the index of refraction of the object.
- The transmission of light from different objects and change of direction is Refraction.
- Light that undergoes refraction gets it own angle relative to the normal of the medium

#### Total Internal Reflection

- Refraction angle 2 cannot be greater than 1 and results in total internal reflection.
- Index of refraction of the lower material, $n_{1}$ must be greater than the $n_{2}$ of the material above it
- Critical angles for $\theta_{2}$ is reached when it equals 90 degrees

### 18.4 Image Formation by Refraction

- Virtual images can be produced from Refraction and what is observed is the virtual image, $P'$ which most of the time looks magnified
- The human eye perceives the refracted rays, and the direction they meet is closer to the boundary 
- The line that cuts through the object and perpendicular to the boundary is the Optical Axis
- $s$ and $s'$ is the distance between the object, $P$ and virtual image $P'$, and the boundary
- $l$ is the distance between the Optical Axis and the normal were refraction occurs

$$s'=\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}s$$

- This equation states the distance between the boundary and virtual image, $s'$ is equal to the index of refraction that the viewer is in, $n_{2}$, over index of refraction that the object is in, $n_{2}$ multiplied by the distance between the boundary and the object, $s$.

### 18.5 Thin Lenses: Ray Tracing

- Lens are transparent objects that uses refraction and curved surfaces 
- Converging Lenses refract lenses towards the optical axis, and diverging lenses does the opposite
- All rays travel parallel to optical axis, then after passing through a lens it will converge to one point, the Focal Point
- The distance between the focal point and lens is the Focal Length
- The focal point on the side the light is entering is called the Near Focal Point, and the other side is the Far Focal Point
- The Near Focal Point of a diverging lens looks like the point where they rays appear to diverge, or another way to interpret is that the 'focal point' where the rays appear to converge when tracing it back. Its like an image refraction

#### Converging Lenses

- A thin lens is ideally zero and is orient that it is in a Lens Plane
- Thin lens approximation allows the following statement to be 'valid': refraction occurs when rays pass the plane, and all distances are measured based from the lens plane
- It can be arbitrarily be stated that the lens plane is the 'midpoint' or the bisecting line of the lens
- Rays that are parallel to the optical axis and passes through the lens refracts into a line that intersects with the far focal point
- Rays that pass through the center of a thin lenses is unaffected
- Rays that intersect the near focal point and enters the lens comes out parallel to the optical axis
- The point the previous rays converge is the image point $P'$
- The plane that $P'$ lies is the image plane
- The the converging rays form the Real Image of Point P, $P$
- The object plane is the vertical axis that the object is in and the images come off points from that axis
- Thin converging lenses create inverted images
- When a screen is placed at $P'$ the image can be seen with great sharpness

#### Diverging Lenses

- Incoming rays that are parallel to the optical axis will diverge into an outgoing ray that can be traced back from its near focal point
- Any incoming ray that is inline with the far focal point will come out parallel to the optical axis
- Then anything that goes through the center is unaffected 
- Diverging lenses always make virtual images
- Diverging lenses are useful for near sighted people

### 18.6 Image Formation with Spherical Mirrors

- Concave mirrors reflect parallel rays in to a single focal point and has the same concept of a converging mirror
- Converging mirrors have rays that appear to diverge behind the mirror.

#### Converging Mirrors

- Converging Mirrors have three special rays
- Parallel rays to the optical axis will bounce back to the focal point
- Anything that passes through the focal point comes back parallel to optical axis
- Anything that hits the center is reflected with angle of reflection equal to angle of incidence
- Converging mirrors kind of act like converging mirrors such that the out coming side is just on the same side of the incident side

#### Diverging Mirrors

- Diverging mirrors always make virtual images, and the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point behind the mirror
- The three special rays are are the same as converging but, the focal point that is used is the one 'behind' the mirror
### 18.7 The Thin-Lens Equation

- Thin-lens equation can be used when s, s', and or f is present (obviously you need at least 2)

## 19 Optical Instruments

### 19.1 The Camera

- Cameras project real images on a plane surface and data is recorded
- The Plane surface of a camera is a detector, it can be light sensitive film or electronic sensor
- Cameras excel when it lens it lesser amounts of rays to produce sharp real images
- Calculating the focusing a camera can be done with the Thin-Lens Equation
- A digital sensor for a camera is a Charge-Coupled Device or CCD
- Use thin lens equations to solve for camera problems, but look out for sign changes due to conditions of lens type and position

### 19.2 The Human Eye

- Human eyes work like a camera
- Corrective Lenses are characterized by refractive power
- Refractive Power is a measure of how much a lens bends rays of light
- Two thin lenses can be added up where the total refractive power is the sum of the two powers 
- SI Unit of refractive Power, $P$ is diopter, $D$
- D unit is $m^{-1}$

#### The Optical System of the Eye

- Refraction of light occurs mostly at the cornea
- Shape of eye lens is manipulated by ciliary muscle
- The focusing of eye is Accommodation
- The furthest a relaxed eye can see is the Far Point
- The closest point an eye can see when contracted is the Near Point

#### Presbyopia

- Loss of range of accommodation is called presbyopia

#### Myopia and Hyperopia

- Farsighted people have the condition called Hyperopia, the power of the lens and cornea is too small for the eyeball
- The refracted rays of light converge past the desired focal point, lenses correct the focal point back
- People with Myopia, their far focal point is way before their sensors and need a diverging lens
- People with Hyperopia need converging lenses to converge the point to the right spot

# Part VI: Electricity and Magnetism

## Chapter 20 Electric Fields and Forces

Vector Components can be used when working with electric forces and fields.

### 20.1 Charges and Forces

### Experimenting with Charges

Objects with no special electrical properties are **Neutral**
The transferring of charges is called **Charging** and objects acquire **Charges**

Rubbing rods with other materials is a process of Charging, and the rods acquire a charge from that point.

The long range force that affect two objects are called Electric Forces, where objects can attract or repel.

Two objects can have Like Charges or Opposite Charges relative to their interaction. Like charges repel each other and Opposites attract.

Electrical forces work at limited distances.

### Visualizing Charge

Charge diagrams show the distribution of charges amongst objects. 

Neutral objects contain equal amount of positive and negative charges.

Charging objects with another object is a transfer of electrons, when there is an excess of electrons for a neutral object holds, it contains a net negative charge.

Law of conservation of charge states charges aren't created or destroyed.

Charge Model states that frictional forces charges objects, charges consists of negative and positive, Electric Forces can either attract or repel depending on like charge and opposite charges, magnitude of charges are based on proximity, neutral charges have net 0 charge, electron transfers causes changes in charges, and charges are conserved.

### Insulators and Conductors

Charges can only transferred through touch, and removing charges via contact is called Discharging.

Conductors are materials where charges moves easily, and Insulators are materials that do not easily move charges.

Items like glass and plastic are insulators, where metals are conductors.

Electrostatic Equilibrium occurs when charges evenly and quickly distribute over a conductor.

### Polarization

Charge Polarization occurs when a charge objected can slightly attract charges from a neutral object. This causes an a charged top and oppositely charge bottom.

Polarization Force happens when charges of an objects are slightly separated.

Polarization force between a charged object and a neutral one is always attractive.

Polarization forces can occur between charged objects and insulators.

### 20.2 Charges, Atoms, and Molecules

Electrons form an Electron Cloud around a [[Atomic Nucleus]]. 

Charge, like mass, is an inherent property of electron and protons.

### An Atomic View of Charging

Electrons and protons are the only sources of charges.

Electrons and protons have exactly the same magnitude of charge regardless of their difference in weight.

Charges of objects are determined by unequal amount of protons and electrons.

Removing electrons from an atom is called [[Ionization]].

Forces of friction cause molecular bonds at the surface as materials slide past each other. 

It sounds like the amount of energy caused by friction literally breaks some bonds, negative ions are placed onto the other object.

But really i think they mean the electrons are transferred and the material ends up with radicals and cations. 

### Charge Conservation

Charges are symbolized with $q$, or $Q$.

The SI Unit for charge is Coulomb (C).

Symbol, $e$, represents Fundamental Charge. The magnitude of the charge of an electron or proton.

Fundamental Charge, $e$, is equal to $1.60*10^{-19} C$

### Insulators and Conductors

Electrons on insulators are tightly bound and not free to move. Charging insulators creates ions but are immobile.

Valence electrons of metals are weakly bound to nuclei.

Metal atoms that form a solid have their electrons orbit around the entire group of electrons like molecular orbital theory (not for real though)

The electrons in conductors act like a sea of electrons that surround charged Ion Cores.

Motion of charges through solids is a **current**, and the the moving charges are called **charge carriers**

Centripetal force can be applied to uniform circular motion of atoms.

$$F=\frac{mv^2}{r}$$

### Electric Dipoles

Equal and opposite charges with a separation is called an Electric Dipole. If the polarization is caused by an external force, then it is an Induced Electric Dipole.

### Hydrogen Bonding

Some molecular structures form Permanent Electric Dipoles, like water molecules that can lead to [[Hydrogen Bonds|Hydrogen bonding]] .

Because their shape is bent, it allows for a net dipole moment to occur.

### 20.3 Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's Law describes the electric force change when objects move farther apart.
The only important value of charge is the magnitude, and notated with absolute value. 

$$F_{1\ on\ 2}=\frac{K|q_{1}|q_{2}|}{r^2}$$

K is equal to the Electrostatic Constant, $8.99*10^9 \frac{N*m^2}{C^2}$

The Law is similar to Gravitational force

$$F_{G}=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}$$



### Using Coulomb's Law

**Electric forces can be super imposed.** The Net force is the sum of all forces.

### 20.4 The Concept of the Electric Field

**alteration of space around charge A that is the agent that exerts a force on charge B**, and the alteration is a **Field**

Space around a charge is altered to ake an **electric field**, for masses it is **gravitational fields**, and magnets are **magnetic fields**

### The Electrical Field is Real

It can be detected by some animals, producing heart beats a charge separation occurs. So do muscles.

### The Field Model

**Field Model** can apply and explain electric fields, 1. a group charges called **source charges** can alter the space around them with an electric field. 2. If another charge is placed in the field, it experiences a force from the field.

Eletric fields are a ratio of force and charge, making their units netwons per coulomb. Magnitude E is called the **electric field strength**

Electrical field strengths are very strong at smaller scales.

**The field is the agent that exerts an electric force on a particle with a charge q**.

Positive charges create an **Electric Field** in space around them
Stronger fields with more field numbers, and increased proximity 
Force field is everywhere, depictions just simplify it to a fixed amount of vectors
Electric field of point charge q at distance r 
Electric field have rays leaving or arrive to one point, have at least four rays for testing for charges


### The Electric Field of a Point Charge

Electric field vectors around a positive point can make up an eletric field diagram.

### 20.5 The Electric Field of Multiple Charges

**The electric field due to multiple charges is the vector sum of electric filed due to each of the charges**

### Uniform Electric Fields

**Electrodes** usually come in pairs nad have equal in magnitude opposite charges. The arrangement is a **parallel-plate capacitor**

### Electric Field Lines

**Electric Field Lines** are imaginary lines drawn through a region so that they are 

### 20.7 Forces and Torques in Electric Fields

**Electric Dipole Moment**
The equilibrium position of a dipole in an electric field is with th electric dipole moment aligned with the field

$$E_{capacitor}=\left( \frac{Q}{e_{0A}} \right)$$

Increasing magnitude of charge on both plates and decreasing area of plates while keeping charge can increase magnitude.

Charge concentrates mostly at corners of objects

**Rule for system of equations** need equal amounts of variables and formulas to make it work

#### Summary

The goal is to understand electric phenomena in the context of charges, forces, and fields.

[[Charge]] is either positive or negative.
[[Fundamental Charge]], $e$, is a magnitude of charge on electron or proton.
If matter has equal amounts of positive or negative charges, then they are neutral.
Charges are conserved like energy.



## Chapter 21 Electric Potential

### 21.1 Electric Potential Energy and Electric Potential

[[Voltage]] is a measure of potential

#### Electric Potential Energy 

Work increases potential energy
A charge can gain [[Electric Potential Energy]], $U_{elec}$, when placed closer to a similar charge.
A charge, q, is analogous to compressing a spring when pushing it towards a fixed source like charge.
The relationship can be recognized as

$$\Delta U_{elec}=W$$

[[Electric Potential Energy]] can be found by figuring out the work done, $W$, to move the charge

#### Electric Potential

[[Electric Fields]] is the agent by which charges exert a long-range force on another charge q.
Electric fields are not a force, but states what force would occur if there was a charge present.
The electric field acting on a charge, q, exerts a force

$$\vec{F}_{elec}=q \vec{E}$$

Electric fields are always present with or without a charge q to be there.
When a charge, q, is present within a field then a force can be calculated.
Electric potential energy only exists when there is a charge and a field; a charge and a field is basically a spring. No spring means no potential energy.

Remember that the total amount of work is equal to the amount of [[Electric Potential Energy]], $\Delta U_{elec}=W$

Charged particle, q, has a potential energy proportional to its charge.

$$\frac{U_{elec}}{q}$$

[[Electric Potential]] is different from [[Electric Potential Energy]]
[[Electric Potential]] is represented with symbol, $V$

$$U_{elec}=qV$$
Relationship between electric potential and electric potential energy

The electric field states what type of force would occur if a charge is present

[[Electric Potential]] is measured in [[volt]], V.

$$1\ volt=1 V=1 J/C$$
### 21.2 Sources of Electric Potential

[[Electric Potential]] is created when charges are separated
If there is no difference between electric potential energy, there is a [[Potential Difference]] of zero.
Batteries uses chemical reactions to create a charge separation.
The potential difference between two points is called [[Voltage]]

### Measuring Electric Potential

[[Voltmeters]] measured the [[Potential Difference]] between two points.

### 21.3 Electric Potential and Conservation of Energy


### 21.4 Calculating the Electrical Potential

$$E=\frac{\Delta V}{d}$$

Electric field strength in terms of the potential difference $\Delta$V between two equipotential surfaces a distance d apart

Closer spacing of points results in stronger electric fields

Inverse proportion 

Just read the book and do the book problems

### Paths of Charged Particles in a Uniform Magnetic Field

Look for corkscrew shapes

## Chapter 23 Circuits

### 23.1 Circuit Elements and Diagrams

[[Circuit Diagrams]] depict a "logical" picture of of circuits with standardized notation.


![[Pasted image 20250409163305.png]]

### 23.2 Kirchoff's Laws

[[Current]] going into a junction is always equal to total out going current, and it's known as [[Kirchoff's Junction Law]] where 

$$\sum I_{in}=\sum I_{out}$$
