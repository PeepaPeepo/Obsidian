$$U_{elec}=qV$$
Relationship between [[Electric Potential]] and [[Electric Potential Energy]].

The unit of electric potential is the [[volt]], $V$.

$$1 volt = 1 V = 1 \frac{J}{C}$$

[[Electric Potential]] is the *potential* for creating [[Potential Energy]] *if* a charge is placed at a certain point. It is represented as the symbol, $V$. 

# Interpretation

$W = qV$ ?

If 1 volt is 1 Joule/Coulomb then

$$Work = q* \frac{J}{C}$$
q = [[Charge]]
