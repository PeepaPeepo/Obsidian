[[Ionic Reactions]] are [[Chemical Reactions]] that involve [[Ions]] at any point of the process, this includes [[Reactants]], [[Intermediate]], and [[Products]]. The polarization results in [[Nucleophiles]] or [[Electrophiles]].

[[Reactants]] don't have to be completely [[Ionization|ionized]], so any [[Polarity]] between atoms create partial charges that can react.

[[Induction]] is the key concept that creates the difference of charges where the difference of [[Electronegativity]] creates the unequal sharing of [[Electron Density]].
