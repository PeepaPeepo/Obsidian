$$\Delta V_{loop}=\sum_{i} \Delta V_{i}=0$$

"$\Delta V_{i}$ is the [[Potential Difference]] across the *i*th component in the loop."

# Tactics Box 23.1 Using Kirchoff's Loop Law

1. **Draw a circuit diagram.** and label known and unknown quantities
2. **Assign a Direction to the [[Current]], $I$.**
3. **"Travel" around the loop.**  Following the current it is either Downstream coming from positive, and going towards negative is upstream. A battery with a current from negative to posti
