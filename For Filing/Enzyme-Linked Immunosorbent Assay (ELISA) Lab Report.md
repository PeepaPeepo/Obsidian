# Introduction

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, ELISA, is a technique to detect and count Proteins. This includes polymers that from enzymes, antigens, antibodies, and hormones. The experiment will be a simulation to detect a diseases between two specimen. Animal samples will be used to simulate the experiment to avoid any actual danger.

# Materials and Methods

## Part 1: ELISA Protocol

10/19/2023
Acquired [[96-Well Plate]] labelled the wells as the following:  Wells 1 - 3 Positive +, Wells 4 - 6 Negative -, Wells 7 - 9 Patient A Sample, and Wells 10 - 12 Patient B Sample.

Using a p200, transferred 50 uL of positive sample into Wells 1 - 3, and 50 uL of negative sample into Wells 4-6.

Transferred 50 uL of Patient Sample A to Wells 7 - 9. Transferred 50 uL of Patient Sample B to wells 10 -12.

Incubated samples at room temperature for 5 minutes. Removed the excess into sink while avoiding backsplash. Using a p200, added 50 uL of wash buffer into each well and removed excess. Repeated once more for a total of 2 rinses.

Using a p200, transferred 50 uL of primary antibody, [[Rabbit Anti-Chicken Polyclonal Antibody]], in each well. Incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. 

Removed the excess into sink while avoiding backsplash. Using a p200, added 50 uL of wash buffer into each well and removed excess. Repeated once more for a total of 2 rinses.

Using a p200, transferred 50 uL of secondary/HRP to each of the wells and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Removed the excess into sink while avoiding backsplash. Using a p200, added 50 uL of wash buffer into each well and removed excess. Repeated once more for a total of 2 rinses.

Using a p200, transferred 50 uL of substrate solution in to each wells. Incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Took photo with Pixel 7a Smart Phone with Automatic Settings.

# Results

**Figure 1:** ELISA test results after completing all materials and methods from lab manual. 

The results of the assay is defined well enough to differentiate. The negative control sample and B sample have a partial color. 

# Discussion

The results found in Figure 1 shows clear distinction between + control sample and A Sample versus - Control Sample and B Sample. The negative control and B sample theoretically should have been completely clear to indicate that there is absolutely no presence of simulated disease. Possible causes can be cross contamination between reagents during pipetting, or disposal of excess was inadequate. Although technically differentiated, experiment should be conducted again to get 'cleaner' results.   

The simulated Antigen was Chicken Gamma Globulin, primary anti-body was Rabbit anti-chicken polyclonal antibody, secondary antibody was Goat Anti-Rabbit Antibody conjugated to HRP, and HRP Enzyme Substrate was 3,3', 5,5' tetramethlbenzidine (TMB).

The blue color of positives sample means that secondary antibody is present, this also means that the primary antibody and antigen was present.  Substrate color change is only sensitive to the secondary antibody. Working backwards, if nothing binds to an antigen it would be rinsed out with the buffer in between each introduction of a new reagent which is evident in the negative and B sample.

# Conclusion

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay is an effective technique to detect proteins and their quantities. Some challenges that occur is actual execution and managing cross contamination, the results of this experiment theoretically could have been better, but more testing is required. Use cases that can be mentioned would be testing a new protein/enzyme design to check what would bind to a certain molecule. Extra research and consulting with instructors can confirm.
