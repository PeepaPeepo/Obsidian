- Carries several hundred [[Genes]]
- Cell division copies DNA molecules
- Information that programs all the cell's activities are encoded in structure of DNA
- Proteins are required to implement genetic programs
- Proteins are like molecular hardware
- DNA is the programming or code
- A given gene along DNA molecule can direct synthesis of RNA called [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid]] or [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]
- it interacts with cell's protein-synthesizing machinery to direct production of polypeptide
	- folds into all or part of a protein
- Flow of information is DNA->RNA->Protein
- Sites of protein synthesis are cellular structures called [[Ribosomes]]
- In [[Eukarya|eukaryotic]] cell, ribosomes are in the [[Cytoplasm]]
	- A region between [[Cell Nucleus]] and [[Plasma Membranes]]
- [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] resides in nucleus
- mRNA conveys genetic instruction for building proteins
- from nucleus to cytoplasm
- [[Prokaryotes]] have cells that lack nuclei but still use mRNA 

## The Components of Nucleic Acids

- [[Nucleic Acids]] are [[Macromolecules]] that exists as [[Polymers]] called [[Polynucleotides]]
- Its monomer are [[Nucleotides]]
	- Generally formed with the following
	- [[Pentoses]] 
	- [[Nucleobases]]
		- one or two rings that include nitrogen atoms
		- Tend to take H+ from solutions
		- Two Families of nitrogenous bases
		- [[Pyrimidines]]
			- 1 Six membered ring of C and N
			- [[Cytosine]]
			- [[Thymine]]
			- [[Uracil]]
		- [[Purines]]
			- Larger, 6 membered ring fused to a five membered ring
			- [[Adenine]] A
			- [[Guanine]] G
		- A, G, and C are universal to purines and pyramidines
		- Thymine only in DNA
		- Uracil only in RNA
	- Sugar is attached to the nitrogenous base and is known as [[Deoxyribose]] or [[Ribose]]
		- Deoxyribose lacks oxygen atom on second carbond in the ring
	- 1 - 3 [[Phosphate Groups]]
- Nucleotides start with 3 phosphate groups
	- two are lost during [[Polymerization]] 
	- Portions of a nucleotide are [[Nucleosides]] when it has no phospate
- 3 phosphates connect to the 5' (5 prime) carbon of pentos
- 1 phosphate creates a nucleoside monophospate or NMP

## Nucleotide Polymers

- Linkage of nucleotides in polynucleotide involves [[Condensation Reactions]]
- Joined by [[Phosphodiester Linkages]]
	- Phosphate group that covalently links sugars of two nucleotides
	- Creates a repeating patter of sugar phosphate units called [[Sugar-Phosphate Backbones]]
	- Nitrogenous bases are not part of the backbone
	- The two ends of the polymer are different
		- one end has phosphate bonded to 5' carbon and are called [[5' Ends]]
		- Other end has a [[Hydroxyl Groups]] on 3' carbon called [[3' Ends]]
	- Phosphate backbones are one way
	- Bases are connected to backbones
- sequence of bases in DNA or mRNA polymers are unique for each gene nad provides specific info to cell
- possible base sequences are limitless
- linear order of bases in a gene specifies the amino acid sequence
	- primary structure of protein
- specifies the proteins 3d structure

## The Structures of DNA and RNA Molecules

- [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] has two [[Polynucleotides]] called strands, winds around imarginary axies
- creates [[Double Helix]], the two [[Sugar-Phosphate Backbones]] in each strand run oncoming towards each other $\ce{ <=> }$ they start from 5' - 3' ends each
- Arrangement is called [[Antiparallel]]
- Sugar phosphate backbones are on the outside of the helix
- nitrogenous bases are paired together
- Strands are held by hydrogen bonds between paired bases
- One DNA helix can include many [[Genes]] a specific segment of double stranded molecule
- Only certain bases are compatible with each other
	- Adenine - Thymine
	- Guanine - Cytosine
- Knowing one strand of the double helix can be used to deduce the other side
	- 5'-AGGTCCG-3'
	- 3'-TCCAGGC-5' 
- Strands of a helix are complimentary
- Makes it possible to generate two identical copies or each DNA molecule
- copies are distributed to Daughter Cells, making it identical to parent cells
- RNA molecules exist as single strands
- complementary base pairing can occur, but between regions of two rna moleucles
- or beetween two streches of nucleodties in the SAME rna molecule
- RNA can take shape necessary for its function
	- [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids]]
	- brings amino acids to ribosome during synthesis of polypeptide
	- about 80 nucleotides long
	- functional shape from base parings are complementary stretches of the molecule

- RNA
	- A pairs with U instead of T in DNA
	- RNA is variable in shape
	- DNA is always a double helix
