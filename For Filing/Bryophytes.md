[[Bryophytes]] are [[Nonvascular Plants]] that include [[Hornworts]], [[Mosses]], and [[Liverworts]]. [[Haploid Gametophytes]] are dominant in all. 

They can produce [[Gametangia]], a structure that produces [[Gametes]].
[[Archegonia]] is a female [[Gametangia]] that produces a nonmotile egg
[[Antheridia]] is a male [[Gametangia]] that produces many motile [[Sperms]]
	Sperm need water to swim to chemical attractants
[[Zygotes]] are retained in the [[Archegonium]]
Many produce in [[Asexual Reproduction]]

Their [[Sporophyte]] are attached to the [[Gametophytes]], and obtain life support from the gametophytes. They are the smallest relative to other plant groups.

# Liverworts

[[Liverworts]] have liver shaped [[Gametophytes]]
Some species have [[Gametangia]] elevated on stalks 

# Hornworts

[[Anthocerotophyta]] 

# Mosses

[[Bryophyta]] have [[Gametophytes]] that are short, [[Sporophyte]] are visible to the naked eye. They are green and photosynthetic when young, then turns brown before releasing spores.

## Ecological importance of mosses

Common in moist forest and wetlands
Inhabits extreme weathered areas
Colonize and retain nitrogen in bare soil
