$$\ce{ \Delta H }$$

[[Enthalpy]] is the emission or absorbance of [[Thermal Energy]], also known as change of [[Heat]]. It is often represented as $\ce{ \Delta H }$ in [[Thermodynamics]] equations. It's always $\ce{ \Delta H }$ since heat is a transfer of energy, it's only measured in difference.

Enthalpy depends on both the initial and final state of the system in question.
