[[Polyatomic Ions]] are [[Elements]] that commonly occur as charged [[Molecules]], mostly existing as [[Anions]]. A subset of [[Polyatomic Ions]] are [[Oxyanions]], which is based on the number of [[Oxygen]] [[Atoms]] that exist in their [[Molecules]].

# Oxyanions

[[Oxyanions]] are oxides of [[Nonmetals]]

## Oxyanions having elements from Groups 14, 15, 16 (4A, 5A, 6A)

The elements (not including halogens) C, N, P, and S can have their row number + 1 of oxygens, and their name will end with -ate.

Their charge is equal to the Element's Valence electrons - 2 (oxygen they can contain).

$\ce{ CO_{3} charge -> 4 - (O_{3})2 = -2}$ Also know as CarbonATE.
Taking away one oxygen atom will conver to CarbonITE. 
-ITE is one less -ATE.

-ATE is IC 
-ITE is OUS acids

## Oxyanions of Halogens

Oxyanions of halogens always have always -1 charges. Their suffix indicates the number of oxygens in the molecule ranging from 4 - 1. The following suffixes are as follows:

Based on Halogen and number of Oxygen bonded to it

Perbromate is $\ce{ BrO_{4}- }$
Bromate is $\ce{ BrO_{3}- }$
Bromite is $\ce{ BrO_{2}- }$
Hypobromite is $\ce{ BrO- }$

4 - Per- x - ate
3 - x - Ate
2 - x - Ite
1 - Hypo - x - ite

# Oxyacid Naming

Names [[Oxyacids]] are based on their [[Oxyanions]]. The follow relationships are as follows for non-halogen oxyanions:

-ate will be -ic Acid
-ite will be -ous Acid

[[Oxyacids]] with [[Halogens]] maintain their [[Oxyanions]] names, but the previous naming scheme will start with 4 oxygens downwards.

Perchloric Acid
Chloric Acid
Chlrous Acid
Hypochlorous Acid

# Some Common Polyatomic Ions

Knowing the oxyanion scheme the polyatomic ions to memorize are acetate, chromate, dichromate, ammonium, permanganate, peroxide, and cyanide
