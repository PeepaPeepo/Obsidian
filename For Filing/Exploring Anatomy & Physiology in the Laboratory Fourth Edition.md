# 1 Introduction to Anatomical Terms

## Exercise 1-4 Regional Terms

[[Regional Terms]] are words for specific locations of a human body to reduce potential errors in communications. Terms are mostly adjectives that follow the word 'region'.

[[Abdominal region]]
[[Acromial region]]
[[Antebrachial region]]
[[Antecubital region]] 
[[Axillary region]]
[[Brachial region]]

[[Upper limbs]] are divide into a [[Arms]] and [[Forearms]]
[[Lower limbs]] are made of [[Thigh]] and [[Leg]]

## Exercise 1.5 Body Cavities and Membranes

Body has several cavities filled with fluid and specific [[Organs]]
Formed by thin sheets of [[Serous Membrane]], the cells of it produce [[Serous fluid]]
[[Parietal layer]] is attached to wall and surrounding structures
[[Visceral layer]] is attached to specific organs

![[Figure 1.6 Body cavities.png]]

[[Posterior body cavity]] is composed of 
	[[Cranial Cavity]] 
	[[Vertebral cavity]]
[[Anterior body cavity]] is composed of 
	[[Thoracic Cavity]] is composed of
		[[Pleural cavities]] 
		[[Mediastinum]] is the cavity between the pleural cavities
		It contains esophagus, trachea, and bronchi
			[[Pericardial Membrane]] is a double layered [[Serous Membrane]] 
				[[Parietal pericardium]]
				[[Visceral pericardium]]
		[[Pericardial Cavity]]
	[[Abdominopelvic cavity]]
		[[Abdominal Cavity]]
		[[Pelvic Cavity]]
		[[Peritoneal Cavity]]
			Surrounded by [[Serous Membrane]] called [[Peritoneal membrane]]
			Outer [[Parietal peritoneum]]
			[[Visceral peritoneum]]
			[[Retroperitoneal]]
