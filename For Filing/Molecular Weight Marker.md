A molecular weight marker is a solution that contains various DNA fragments. Each fragment is of a known [[Base Pairs]] (bp) length. On agarose gel, markers can be visualized as groups of bands. Each band will represent a certain bp length, from 100 to 1500 bp. The marker acts as a standard that allows for determination of experimental band sizes. The molecular weight marker is known as DNA ladder.
