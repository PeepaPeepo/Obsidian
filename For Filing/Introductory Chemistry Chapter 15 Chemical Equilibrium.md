# Dynamic Equilibrium

[[Dynamic Equilibrium]] involves two opposing processes occurring at the same rate
$$\ce{ N_{2}O_{4}<=>2NO_{2} }$$
Two opposing reactions occur at the same rate

[[Systems]] vs [[Surroundings]]

# Equilibrium Involves sameness and constancy

Sameness with surrounding

# Life: Controlled Disequilibrium

Definition of living things that are not in equilibrium with their surroundings
Living things maintain Disequilibrium
Controlled Disequilibrium

# The Rate of a Chemical Reaction

Concept of equilibrium
Reaction rates are related to chemical equilibrium because a chemical system is at equilibrium when the rate of the forward equals the rate of reverse 

If forward process is disproportionately higher than the reverse than the reverse might be much lesser

[[Rate of Chemical Reactions]]  is a measure of how fast the reaction proceeds is defined as the amount of reactant that changes to product in a given period of time

$$\ce{ rate of Reaction = \frac{-dReactant}{dt} }$$
# Collision Theory of Chemical Reactions 

[[Chemical Reactions]] occur through collisions between molecules or atoms
If collision occurs with enough energy, a reaction can occur
If not enough energy, then reaction cannot proceed
[[Free Energy of Activation|Activation Energy]]
[[Gases]] have wide distribution of velocities
High-Energy collisions lead to products 
Factors is [[Molar Concentration]], [[Temperature]] of the reaction mixture

Rate of reaction is formation of product or depletion of reactant 
Constant amount of reactant and product in a reaction
Rate of reaction can be based on each reactant

[[Dynamic Equilibrium]] is the amount of reactant and product
[[Rate of Chemical Reactions]] are how fast the process takes

Product/Reactant = Dynamic equilibrium

$\ce{ A->Product }$

$\ce{ Rate=k[A] }$ is a first order reaction

Do not use coefficients 

$\ce{ Rate=k[A]^2 }$ second order reaction

$\ce{ rate=k[A]^o }$ zero order reaction/ psuedo zero order needs little activation

$\ce{ [A]0 }$ is the intial concentration

[[Half-Life]] 

$\ce{ [A]0 -> \frac{[A]0}{2} = t\frac{1}{2}}$

Orders are found through experimentation

## Writing Equilibirium expressions for chemicals

Large $\ce{ k_{eq} }$ valules will have high concentration of products

given 
$\ce{ [H]2 }$ = 0.11 M
$\ce{ [I]2 }$ =  0.11 M

## Effect of volume decrease on equilibrium

[[La Chatelier's Principle]]

### Effect of concentration

$$\ce{ N_{2}O_{4}<=>2 NO_{2} }$$
$$\ce{ K_{eq} = \frac{[NO_{2}]^2}{[N_{2}O_{4}]} }$$
Increasing reactant shifts reaction towards product

### Effect of Volume changes volume

[[Ideal Gas Law]] 

$$\ce{ PV=nRT }$$

P proportionate to n 
Go to the direction to the lower amount of moles 

## Chemistry and Health: Developing fetus getting oxygen form its mother

Hebmoglobin reacts with oxygen according to quilibirum equation
Equilibrium constant for this reaction is niether large nor small
Blood flows through lungs were oxygen concentrations are high
Eq shifts to the right, hemoglobin loads oxygen
blood flowing through muscle and organs that are using oxygen the quilibrium to the lef

**Greater concentration leads to the lower concentration side**

Greater reactant shifts towards products

$$\ce{ HbF + O_{2} <=> HbFO_{2} }$$

Fetal hemoglobin HbF is slightly different from adult hemoglobin
eq constant for fetal hemoglboin is larger than eq for adult
fetal hemoglobin loads o2 at lower concnetraiton
mothers hemoglobin flows through placenta

## Effect of Temperature

$\ce{ aA + bB <=> cC +/- heat}$ 

$\ce{ k_{eq} = \frac{[C]^c}{[A]^a[B]^b} }$

[[Endothermic Reactions]]
[[Exothermic Reactions]]

Excess heat shifts towards the lesser heat

## Equilibrium as a Function of Temperature

Endothermic reacitons, warm temperatures cause a shift to the right towards produciton of brown NOo2

Cool is the opposite

$\ce{ CaSO_{4}_{(aq)} <=> Ca^2+_{(aq)} + SO_{4}^2-_{(aq)}}$

[[Catalysts]] lowers [[Free Energy of Activation]] 

# 15.1 Life: Controlled Disequilibrium

[[Equilibrium]] can be defined as sameness and constancy 
Living things are not in [[Equilibrium]] and maintain Controlled [[Disequilibrium]]

# 15.2 The Rate of a Chemical Reaction

[[Rate of Chemical Reactions]] is the measure of how fast the reaction proceeds is defined as the amount of [[Reactants]] that change into [[Products]] in a given period of time

Fast is large amount of reactant converted
Slow reactions have smaller amounts of products

## Collision Theory

[[Collision Theory]] states that chemical reactions occur through between [[Molecules]] or [[Atoms]]

High energy collisions lead to products
[[Free Energy of Activation|Activation Energy]] is the barrier that needs to be overcome for a reaction to proceed

Important factors are [[Molar Concentration]] and [[Temperature]]

## How Concentration Affects the Rate of Reaction

[[Rate of Chemical Reactions]] generally increases with increasing concentrations
As reactions proceeds, their concentration decreases
Generally decrease as a reaction proceeds

## How Temperature Affects the Rate of Reactions

Higher [[Temperature]] equates to faster movement and higher rate of collision
Higher velocity have higher kinetic energy

# 15.3 The Idea of Dynamic Chemical Equilibrium

[[Reversible Reactions]] can proceed in both directions
[[Dynamic Equilibrium]] occurs when forward and reverse rate equal each other
Reactions are still occurring just at the same rate

# 15.4 The Equilibrium Constant: A Measure of How Far a Reaction Goes

[[Concentrations]] of reactants are not equal to products
[[Equilibrium Constants]] quantifies relative concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium, it. is the ratio at equilibrium of the concentration raised to their stoichiometric coefficients divided by concentrations of reactants

$$\ce{ aA + bB <=> cC + dD }$$
$$\ce{ K_{eq} = \frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b} }$$

lower case letters are stoichiometric coefficients 
**Products over Reactants**

## Writing Equilibrium Constant Expressions for Chemical Reactions

Products over Reactants, and raise them by their [[Coefficients]]

## Significance of the Equilibrium Constant

$\ce{ K_{eq} \gg 1}$ (much greater than)
$\ce{ K_{eq} \ll 1}$
$\ce{ K_{eq} \approx 1}$

# 15.5 Heterogeneous Equilibria: The Equilibrium Expression for Reactions Involving a Solid or Liquid

If solids, concentrations are constant
Do not include pure solids (s) and pure liquids (l)

# 15.6 Calculating and Using Equilibrium Constants

[[Equilibrium Constant Expression]] is relationship between constant and amounts of reactant and products at equilibrium

## Calculating Equilibriums Constants

Equilibrium constants depend on temperature
Concentrations are always in [[Molarity]]
[[Particular Concentrations]] of reactants and products for reaction is not always the same

[[Equilibrium Constants]] are awalys the same at given temperature regardless of concentrations

## Using Equilibrium Constants in Calculations

Plug that shit in!

# 15.7 Disturbing a Reaction at Equilibrium: Le Châtelier's Principle

[[Le Châtelier's Principle]] states that a chemical system will respond to minimize disturbance

# 15.8 The Effect of a Concentration Change on Equilibrium

Increase in products will increase rate of reverse of reaction
Increasing the concentration of one or more of th reactions will cause shift to hte products
vice versa

# 15.9 The Effect of a Volume Change on Equilibrium

Change in pressure 
**Pressure and volume are inversely related**
If volume of reaction changes, the the system shifts
[[Boyle’s Law]]
[[Ideal Gas Law]]

Decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift in the direction that has fewer moles of gas particles

Increasing volumes causes reactions to shift in the direction for more moles of gas particles

**If a chemical reaction has equal number of moles of gas particles on both sides, there is no effect**

# 15.10 The Effect of a Temperature change on Equilibrium

[[Exothermic Reactions]]
[[Endothermic Reactions]]

Adding heat to product will shift to reactant
Removing heat will shift to the reactatn 

# 15.11 The Solubility-Product Constant

[[Solubility-Product Constant]] $\ce{ K_{sp} }$ is the [[Equilibrium]] expression that represents dissolving of an ionic compound

**Omit solids from equations**

**Higher Ksp means higher solubility and vice versa**

## Using $\ce{ K_{sp} }$ to determine Molar Solubility

[[Molar Solubility]] is solubility in units of [[Moles]] per [[Liter]]. Can be calculated from $K_{sp}$
$K_{sp}$ is not the molar solubility, but a solubility product constant

Set $\ce{ K_{sp} }$ to molar concentrations of dissolved chemicals

[[Solubility]] is equal to each molar concentration of products

$\ce{ Solubility = S = [Ag+] = [Cl-] }$
$\ce{ K_{sp} = S*S or S^2 }$

# 15.12 The Path of a Reaction and the Effect of a Catalyst

[[Equilibrium Constants]] describe how far a reaction will go 
[[Rate of Chemical Reactions]] is how fast
[[Free Energy of Activation|Activation Energy]] exist because original bonds must being to break

## How Activation energies affect reaction rates

## Catalysts Lower the Activation Energy 

is a substance that increases the rate of chemical reaction without being consumed

# Review

## 15.1 Life: Controlled Disequilibrium

[[Equilibrium]] as sameness and constancy
Living things are in controlled Disequilibrium

# 15.2 The Rate of a Chemical Reaction

[[Rate of Chemical Reactions]] is a measure of how fast a chemical reaction proceeds, and not to be confused with [[Equilibrium]]. Specifically the rate of reactants converting to products

[[Collision Theory]] states that chemical reactions occur through collisions of atoms or molecules

Higher energy collisions are more likely to lead to products because most chemical reaections have [[Free Energy of Activation|Activation Energy]]
Two factors that affect collision are temperature and concentration

## How Concentration Affects the Rate of a Reaction

Rate of chemical reactions generally increase with increasing concentration of the reactants
During forward process, the concentration decreases along with rate

## How Temperature Affects the Rate of a Reaction

[[Reaction Rates]] depends on [[Temperature]]
More collisions per unit time
Higher energy collisions

Rate of chemical reactions increase with temperature; doubling every 10 degrees celcius
