[[Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases]] states the follow:

1. A gas is as collection of particles ([[Molecules]] or [[Atoms]]) in constant , straight line motion
2. [[Gases|Gas]] particles do not attract or repel each other, they do not interact besides colliding and bouncing
3. A lot of space between the particles compare to the size of the particles themselves
4. Speed of particles increase with increasing [[Temperature]]

$Force = Pressure * Area$
