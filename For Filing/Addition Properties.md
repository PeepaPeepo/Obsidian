# Commutative Property of Addition

Changing orders of [[addends]] does not change the sum

## Example

a + b = b + a

# Associative Property of Addition

When adding multiple addends, the grouping does not affect the sum.

## Example

1 + (2 + 4) = (1 + 2) + 4

# Identity Property

When 0 is added to a value, the sum is equal to itself

## Example

a + 0 = a
