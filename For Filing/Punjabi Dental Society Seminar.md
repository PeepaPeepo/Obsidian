societal view of the legal and medical systems
societal view of dollars worth
consumer culture, patient as a buyer of a service
	Younger generations that fixate on it
work/debt conundrum
red flag patient groups

# Professional Malpractice

Providing care that diverges from standard of care which causes damages
Patient needs to prove connection and evidence

# Standard of Care

What a reasonable dentist of similar training or experience would or would not do under the same or similar circumstances

# Informed Consent (or lack thereof)

Can I have patients sign after?
Signed forms is not enough

# Informed consetn errors

Occurs due to poor communication 
clerical error
patient selection

# Minimum disclosures  and the discussion

What is the patients current condition
proposed treatment options?
explanation of purposes of the procedure
Risks and benefits
risks if tx not undertaken
alternatives to the proposed procedures
expected outcomes
patient's questions and understanding of the proposed plan

Explain the process and how many appointments
**Let patients asks questions**

Failitre to cover any of these disclosures, the duty is non-delegable

# Informed Consent and Documentation* 

Condition and suggested treatment
Risks  of suggested treatment
patient education
options in compromise
patient desires

# Customized Consent

Patients cannot make an informed decision about hteir own risks or benefits with any given therapy based soley on population wide data

# Case Study 1 Informed Consent

[[Informed Consent]]

Because the patient was numb, he could not embouchure to play the trumpet and couldn't return to career

Wage loss component

Extent of discussion

Informed consent discussion was done by the D 
Patient's profession carrer was not take into consideration

Other TX options
32 was asymptomatic?

[[Coronectomy]] could have been performed

Patient claims he did not read the informed consent documents 

# Informed Consent RIsk Tips

Effective informed consent is a process not a form 
Proper implementation helps engage
Teach back methods can help gauge patient comprehension of information received during the informed consent process

# Preoperative Treatment Error

## Surgical errors

Poor pre procedure planning
Practicing beyond one's ability
poor communication
clerical errors in communications

## Examples

Extraction of the wrong tooth due to DA
perforation of a root
wrong sidded surgery
implant placement in a IAN canal space

# Case Study to, Surgical Pre-Op

General abnomrality along buccal gingival margin of !18 and #18 on left side of patient's mouth, reffereed to perio

Biopsied wrong side second visit

Documentation Error
Poor Team Communication 
Pre-Op System Failure
**Implement a critical language policy**
"Hi doctor, i want a few things clarified"

Pre Op System Failure

No pre op site verificaiton by OMS
Time out Protocol
When in doubt stand still 

# In Summary

Wrong treatment occurs from miscommuncaitons and dentist oversight
Fail to recognize they rendered treatment on incorrect tooth 
preventative measures, pre-procedure time outs
Independent evaluation of symptioms and patient complaints as well infomred consent confirmation from the patietn can serve as a defense in the wrong tooth case
Communications between general and specialists is highly suggested

# Intraoperative Errors

## Anesthesia

Poor patient sleection
poor management of the patient intraoperatively
communication errors

Failure to properly dose
fail to monitor
fail to recognize signs and symptoms of distress
failure to timely intervene
failure to complete an anestheisa record 
Make sure to have all required equipment

# Case Study 3 Anesthesia

Cerebral palsy and seaizure disorder
Did not inform patient about the desturation episode of general anesthesia
Patient died the following day
[[Desaturation]]

# Anesthesia Record Keeping

Need to have all vitals charted
If there is change in BP, 02 sats, RR, or HR
Records need to indicate intervetion type
How long it took to take intervention
result of intervention attemps

clinical notes and electronics tracings must mat ch 

ET tube not cuffed
unuffed tubes prone to migration especially in long procedures
Deflate balloon cuff to prevent necrosis

Document when changes made and why

No Notation

knpow fluid input output during long procedures

no dinication of tempeture was taken

Preop clearance

consider red flag patients with coorbidities

Does pcp know exactly the procedure the aptient will undergo

patient's Father was not told about hte desaturation episode. and no instruction to monitor

# Post Treatment Errors, Failure to Follow Up

## Causes

Poor Patient communication
Poor management and office follow up systems
clerical error

## Examples

Failure to detect oral cancer
fail to detect nerve injury
fail to diagnose mandiublar fracture
failure to recognize signs of infection
fialure on ordered labs

Failure to follow up

Swelling but was never to visit
not asked about swelling or location
Dr never called patient
Should never given medrol as it s a corticoseroid, will reduce ability to fight infection

Pre Op Abx Prescription

judgement call 
modern trend is to steer clear of prescribing abx

Although follow up is imperative setting the foudnation though good patient communication can keep most of these cases from evoling in the first place

# Case Study 5 Failure to follow-up

non compliant patients, wanted patient to recall appointment, patient didn't comply
slight abnormality to returned
paitent complained of pain in his jaw and in his gums
Patienet has Squamous cell carcinoma of the jaw, requiring a hemimandibulectomy
Patient didn't return for 1 years and 7 months

Explain why the patient needed to follow up 
Call the patient when he did not return and advise him to follow up

Follow up undocumented

No documented instances by insured or his staff to follow up with the patient when he missed his subsequent appointments

Had patient followed up as necessary, ithe lesion could have bee nresected using less invasive means 

# Difference about post op cases

## More about

Communication between patient and dentist
communication among providers
failure to obtain consult or referral

# Follow up system failures

No news is no news
utilize your patient as your last line of defense
pracice needs to take responsiblit and set communication and appointment follow ups
try to stay away form if you havent heard from us by
staff egnagement and responsibility is imparetive

# Malpractice Carrier

The insured, claims consultant, risk consultant, and defense attornety

Frequent communcation with insured
Pure consent clause available in policies

Risks opportunity for additional training

# The New Normal in Infection Control

Abby Teh

# Top 9 Mistakes

Not having a written program
	A manual of some sort
	OSHA book
use OSHA Review as a guide

# Hazard Communication Program

Right to know the identity and hazard of chemicals that tehy use in the workplace
Employee right to know alw
Implement a hazard communication program

Hazard classificaiton
	classified into categoies that compare hazards
	same lable requirement for sister chemicals
LAbels all labels will now include a harmonzied signal word, pictogram, and hazard statment
Safety Data Sheet

Revision of the HCS standard
	OSHA Revision of HCS and adopted globally harmonized system of classiviation

GHS Pictograms

# Employee Training

Required when hired
When new chemical product is added
Once a year for all continuing

Records of each training sesison 
training records are to be retained for 5 years
***Lunch and Learns are acceptable***

# Missing Data Sheet or poorly organized SDS that cannot be accessed in the event of an emergency

Printable SDS from supplier 

# Having no eye wash or having a eyewash that is not accesible or functioning

Eye wash sation must be accessible for all emplyees
withint 55 feet
must be inspected and actvated weekely run to 10 to 15 second
assign an employeee to do this 
record and document the inspection

# Not offering exposed employees the hepatitis B vaccine and or not having a sign declination form for those who do no want the vaccinae

HBV virus
survive outside for a week
contagous
immun reccommeneded
hep b not curable

TB and Hep vaccine and tests required

Category I and II tasks

Category I is direct assistant
II hybrid workers
Or DA
Vaccine must be offered within 10 days of emplyoment
Dentist employer must obtain prof rom the physician who administered the vaccination
Employee has the right ot refuse the HBV vacc
Employee needs inofmred refusal form
Employee always have have the right change his or her mind and receivee

OSHA blood borne pathogens standard declination

# Not providing baseline TB testing for all emplyoees and new emplyoess

Its only one time

Emplyee that had a needle stick accident or some occupational injury

*Tuberculosis* is airborn
symptoms include fatigue, fever 

# Measures to Contain respiratory Secretion

Cover mouth with tissue when coughing or sneezing
Use neares trash can
perofmr hand hygeiene after having contact with respiratory secretion and contaminated objects or materials
Offer masks to coughing patients 
Encourage people with symptoms to sit as far away from others as possible
elbow sneeze is ineffective

# Visual Alets

reminders of patients and staff
related materials are available at COver your cough and important notice to all patients

# Not Providing Training for Employees

## Communication of bloodborne pathogens hazard to employees

Training Requirements

At the time of intial assignment
atleast annually 
when changes occur in workfplace
First priority of training is infection control
120 day limit to train 

# Failure to provde exposure treatment and couseling to exposed employees

Before an accident occurs the BBP require the employer to have a written plan
Theis plan explains exactly what steps the employees must follow after the exposure

## Exposure control plan: Exposure evaluation and follow

Immediately notify your supervisor
wash needle sticks with soap and water
if nose or mouth, flush with water 
if eyes irrgate with water using your eye wash

## Writen Incident Report

Date and time of exposure
procedure details, what where how
entry rout, fluid involved, volume duration of contact
infomration about source person and exposed person
idfentify an occupatioanl medicine clinic in your area who you will refer to

## Post Exposure evaluation and follow up 

id source patient for HBV, HCV, and HIV
Collecting and testing the exposure worker blood
offering post exposure prohpy and couseling
evaluation of repored ilnlness
source individual test resul made 
have all blank pos exposure form ready to go before an accident occurs

AFTER THE EMPLOYEE HAS RECIEVED POST EXPOSURE FOLLOW UP THE EMPLOYER WILL OBTAIN A WRITTEN OPINION FROM THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDED AND PROVIDE IT TO THE EMPLOYEE WITHIN 15 WORKING DAYS
WRITTEN OPION FOR POST EXPSURE EVAL AND FOLLOW UP INLCUDE INFOMRATION TAHT HAS BEEN

# Not having a written exposure control plan

## Required in the plan 

Idenfitication of hazard in the workplace 
identification of which task could exposre emplyoees
id of which employees may have potential exposure
identification of approriate PPE 
training of exmployees on use and care of PPE

## Exposure Control Plan

Required in the plan

Implementtation of various method of exposure control such as 

Standard precaution

Engineering and workplace controls
House keeping

Access to receiving the hepatitis B
Process of post exposure evalatuion and follow up
recrod keeping

## Standard and Universal Precautions

Treat everyone is infectious
CDC Changes

Standad precaution integerate the elements of universal precautiosn into standard of care designed to protect healthcare providers from pathogens that can be spread by blood or any body lfuid, exretion or secretion

It is not possilbe ot identify those individuals who are infectious so infection precautions are used for all healthare presonnnel and their patients

Exposure Control PLan Engineering Controls

Whenever possible engineering conrols hsould be the primary method to reduce exposure to blood born
These controls remove or isolate the hazard
Frequently technology based, self sheathing anesthetic needles, safety scapels, and needleness iv ports

sharps containers and needle recapping devices

Two part solutions to turn sharps into one solid piece of matter

# Managing Contaminated Sharps

Contamined needles and other disposable sharps
Sharps container is located close as possible to area of treatment
Do not cut or bend needles before disposable
never atempt to remove a needle from a disposable syringe

**Empty Carpules**

# Peronsla protective equipment

Osha requires PPE

Protective clothing
surgical masks
face shields
protective eyewear
disposable patient treatment gloves
heavy duty utility gloves

# Covid Related Problems

Not conducting fit testing of respiratiors
No written respiratory protection plan
not having a medical evaluation for those employees who wear respirators

Should not be treating known or suspected covid 19 patients in your office
They should be treated in a special facility with negative air pressure isolation

# Roles and resposnbilitities of the CDC and osha in infection contorl

federal agencies that play important roles in infection contorl

# OSHA 

Safe for employees
Emergency Tmporary standard no longer applies to most dental office if screening conducted for all who enter facility
The only eception whould be facility 

# Following OSHA regulation and CDC Guidelines

All office should perform a void 19 hazard assessment
Continue to provide annual required OSHA training to all employees
Provide training to all new employees as part of the on boarding process

# OSHA Training Records

Training records must include the following

dates of the training

content or summary of the training session

names and qualification of persons conducting the training
names and job titels of all attending the session
training records must be maintaining for 3 years from the date on which the training occurs 

# Osha inspection what to expect

Ask for OSHA manual wirrten documents

Written hazard communication plan
SDS binder
Written exposures control plan
training records 

check for required documents
interview employees
inspect the facility for compliance with OSHA standards
comment on and note hazard present
send results several weeks later
citations may be contested

30 Day grace period for contesting
