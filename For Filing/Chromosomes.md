[[Chromosomes]] are the form of genetic material during [[Cell Division]]. [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] condenses and coils into the x shaped form of [[Chromosomes]] after it replicates. After [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] has replicated, it consists of two identical copies called [[Chromatids]], and they are attached to the central region called [[Centromeres]]

[[Chromosomes]] consist of an organized single molecule of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]Â wrapped around 5 kinds of [[Proteins]] called [[Histones]]. When it is unorganized, it is [[Chromatin]]

Chromosomes contain small segments of DNA called genes, which code for proteins. DNA is made of nucleotides. Nucleotides are the DNA "code" and determine what proteins are made by a given gene.
