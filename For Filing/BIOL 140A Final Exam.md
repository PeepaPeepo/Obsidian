At this point you should understand the entire process of DNA replication, RNA transcription and protein translation. This includes all of the regulatory elements such as Ori,'s, promoters. You should know the cell organelles and how each of them work. Know the secretory pathway. Know what Apoptosis is. Understand what an atom is and the basic workings of an atom. Understand water chemistry. Know the functional groups and the constituents of the cell. Know how to make a polypeptide. You should know the structure of the amino acids and how to create a polypeptide chain. Know how to draw a base pair, not just the bases the whole NTD. Go over your past study guides to help you out.

You should be able to utilize your knowledge of experiments accomplished in the lab to answer questions on the final exam.
