- [[Chemical Bonds]] between [[Nonmetals]] and [[Metals]]
- Each [[Elements]] that form [[Ionic Bonds]] are either [[Cations]] or [[Anions]], and their charges must cancel out to bond together
- Ionic bonds form [[Formula Units]] since the don't covalently bond together
- Metal has a high change of losing its [[Electrons]] and transferring it somewhere else
- Ionic bonds has a transfer and no share of electrons, the charge difference between the two bond the two [[Elements]] together
