[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]] is a class of [[Enzymes]] that are involved with [[DNA Replication]].

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]] [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] by attaching [[Nucleotides]] to the 3' end of a pre existing chain. 3' ends of a [[Sugar-Phosphate Backbones]] contain an open [[Hydroxyl Groups]] read to be attached.

[[Escherichia Coli|E. Coli]] has different types of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]] such as [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerases I|DNA Pol I]], [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerases II|DNA Pol II]], and [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase III|DNA Pol III]]
