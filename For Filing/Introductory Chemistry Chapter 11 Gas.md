# 11.1 Extra Long Straws

[[Pressure]] as force exerted per unit area by gas molecules as they collide with the surfaces around them
Depends on concentration of gas, 
Earth's atmosphere us an average pressure of $\ce{ 101,325 \frac{N}{m^2} }$
Sucking on straw reduces number of collisions that occur from gas, and lowers pressure
The pressure on the outside of the straw is the same
It causes a pressure differential 

Soda can rise up the stra until the pressure extered by its weight equals the pressure extered by the molecules in our atmosphere

# 11.2 Kinetic Molecular Theory: A Model for Gases

[[Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases]] predicts behavior of most gases under specific conditions

Gases are compressible because of the space
Apply external pressures pushes particles closer
Liquids and solids cannot because they are already basically adjacent to each other 

# 11.3 Pressure: The Result of Constant Molecular Collisions

[[Pressure]] is the result of the constant collisions between the atoms ore molecules in a gas and the surfaces around them

Pressure decreases with increasing altitude
Most airplane cabins are pressurized

Unit of pressure is [[Atmosphere]] or atm, the average pressure at sea level, SI unit is the [[Pascal]] 
Pascals are much smaller than atm

$$\ce{ 1 atm = 101,325 Pa }$$

Another unit of pressure is [[Millimeter of Mercury]] which is how [[Barometers]] worked
Mercury is higher density so the range it increases is shorter per atm

$$\ce{ 1 atm = 760 mm Hg }$$

A millimeter of mercy is also called a Torr
[[Inches of Mercury]] and [[Pounds per Square Inch]] 
[[Atmosphere|atm]] or [[Pascal]] might be the best unit to convert to first

# 11.4 Boyle's Law: Pressure and Volume

[[Pressure]] of [[Gases]] depend on its [[Volume]]
[[Pressure]] increases when volume decreases 
Increasing volume causes a decrease in internal pressure
Volume and pressure is inversely related

[[Boyle’s Law]] The volume of a gas and its pressure are inversely proportional
Can be used to calculate vol of gas following a change of pressure or volume if temperature is constant

# 11.5 Charles' Law: Volume and Temperature

Volume of gas is linearly related with increasing temperature

[[Extrapolation]]

[[Charles’s Law]] 

# 11.6 The Combined Gas Law; Pressure, Volume, and Temperature

The combination of the two laws are as follows

[[Combined Gas Law]]  

# 11.7 Avogadro's Law: Volume and Moles

[[Avogrado's Law]] states the volume of a gas and the amount of the gas in [[Moles]] (n) are directly proportional

## Partial Pressures in Mixtures of Gasses 

$$\ce{ P = 1 atm }$$

What is the total pressure of all gases at one atmosphere?
$\ce{ 0.78*1atm + 0.21 }$

Take the percentages of the gases that take up the atmosphere like AMU calculations.

$\ce{ P_{total}=P_{a} + P_{b}\dots}$

[[Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure of Gases]] $\ce{ = mole fraction of component A * P_{total} }$

[[Lungs]] are adjusted at natural [[Atmosphere]]
[[Hypoxia]] happens during rapid change of pressure
[[Oxygen Toxicity]] happens during excess oxygen intake that commonly happens at lower sea levels

[[Heliox]] is a mixture of helium and oxygen usually at a smaller percentage of oxygen that would be found in air. It is used for deep sea differs to compensate for pressure change. [[Nitrogen Narcosis]] also referred to as rapture of the deep

## Vapor Pressure

[[Vaporization]] 
[[Vapor Pressure]] 
All [[Systems]] have [[Vaporization]]
Dependent on temperature

## Molar Volume at Standard Temperature and Pressure

[[Standard Temperature and Pressure]] or [[Standard Temperature and Pressure|STP]] 
Look at STP formula/Ratio

## Chemistry in the Environment: Air Pollution

[[Sulfur Dioxide]]
[[Carbon Monoxide]]

[[Ozone]] = $\ce{ O_{3} }$ is an outer atmosphere that filters harmful uv light

Nitrogen Dioxide is emitted by vehicles and electricity generation plants

$\ce{ SO_{2} }$ and $SO_{3}$ - $\ce{ SO_{x} }$ (Sox) + $\ce{ H_{2}O ->H_{2}SO_{3} }$ 
Sulfurous Acid

## Collecting Gases over Water

$\ce{ Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq)->ZnCl_{2}(aq) + H_{2}(g) }$

When the product of a chemical reaction is gaseous is, it is often collected by the displacement of water

[[Vapor Pressure]] depends on temperature, it increases with rising temp because more water molecules evaporate

Subtract known water vapor pressure from total pressure in question

## If you double the pressure of a constant amount of gas at a constant temperature, what happens to the volume?

The volume is one-half the initial volume.

At constant temperature and amount of gas, volume is inversely related to pressure. _Increasing the pressure_ by a factor of 2 (doubling) will decrease the volume by the same factor (the reciprocal of 2, or 1/21/2).

## Each gas sample has the same temperature and pressure. Which sample occupies the smallest volume?

According to Avogadro's law, the volume of a gas and the amount of gas (n) are directly proportional at constant temperature and pressure.

##   How many moles of gas must be forced into a 4.8 LL tire to give it a gauge pressure of 34.2 psipsi at 27 ∘C∘C? The gauge pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure. Assume that atmospheric pressure is 14.6 psipsi so that the total pressure in the tire is 48.8 psipsi.
