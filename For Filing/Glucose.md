$$C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$$

[[Glucose]], also known as Dextrose, is a simple sugar [[Monomers|monomer]] that make up [[Disaccharides]] and [[Polysaccharides]]. It is made out of a six carbon [[Carbon Skeletons|skeleton]] with a [[Carbonyl Groups]] attached to its end, and it's most stable form is a hexene ring. ==The formation is caused by the H of the 5' [[Hydroxyl Groups]] linking to the oxygen of the [[Carbonyl Groups]].==

Depending how it links with other Glucose it can form [[Polysaccharides]] such as [[Starch]] and [[Cellulose]], or [[Disaccharides]] such as [[Maltose]], [[Sucrose]], and [[Lactose]] depending on what the other [[Carbohydrates|Saccharide]] it forms a [[Glycosidic Linkages|glycosidic link]] with.
