**What is the role of the kidneys, liver, epidermis in this process? Be as specific as possible based on the reading source provided.**

**Are osteocytes passive “bystanders” in the process of remodeling? Why or why not?**

0:14 Fat Soluble Vitamin and water souluble hormone
0:20 Two types of Vitamin D: D_2 and D_3, D_3 is synthesised in skin, and needed for bone strength, etc and needs to be activated
1:11. 7 Dehydrocholesterol is found in skin, UV-B rays activates 7 dehydrocholestorol then turn into Cholecalciferol D_3 which is inactive. The liver adds hydroxl at 25-hydroxylse
1.18. 7-Dehydrocholesterol is found in skin then is convered into cholescalciferol via UV lights. It makes vitamin D3. It can also obtained via dietary supplements
2.04 Liver has 25-hydroxylase and convers cholealciferol into 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, 25-Hydroxy D3, or Calcifediol. This is the formation of still inactive vitamin D, but its a circulatory form that is bound to a proteinAlpha Globulin
2:37 needs cofactors such as NADPH, O_2 and Mg for vitamind D synthesis
3:02 Kidney is important that 1alpha hydroxylase adds another hydroxl to make a 1,25-Dihyroxycholecalciferol or Calcitriol and is active D_3 which is important form for intestine interaction
3:57 Active D_3 is needed for Ca absorption, excess will be hydrolated at 24 to form DHCC inactive which can form metabolites
4.36 1alpha hydroxy lase is a rate limiting step and regulated by calium, phosphate, and PTH, excess D3 inhibits synthesis
5.02 Calcium taken in diet with small intestin, absorbed into ECF, secred in gi , ecf exchange with icf, ecf deposition in to bone, ecf filted by kidneys and comes back
5.49 vitamin D acts on small intestin,e kidney and bone to maintain homeo states, main site is small intestine
6.01 intestinal site, enterocyte Ca transfer in two ways :Paracellular and Transceullar pathway 
6.33 Paracellcular pathway is between two cells and influenced by vitamin d
10.42 Vitamin D and PTH increase Ca reabsorption, with vitamind D its protein synthesis, Phospahte increases resorption
11.17 Net effect is to increase ECF ca and Phopshate
