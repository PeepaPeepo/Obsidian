# Antibiotics in Fungi Lab Report

# Introduction

Penicillium Notatum will be screened for any antibiotic properties by checking how it interacts with e. coli in an incubated Luria Bertani agar plate. There will be discs saturated with fungal extract, tap water, and tetracycline present in the LB agar plate. Depending on how the e. coli reacts and grows, Penicillium Notatum can be compared to the tetracycline control disc to determine if it contains any anti-biotic properties.  

# Materials and Methods

## Part I: Preparation of Fungal Extract; Plating of Extract

09/26/2023
Using a sterile disposable plastic loop, transferred a loop's worth of Penicillium Notatum from sample plate to disinfected mortar and pestle. Using a p1000 pipette, transferred $\ce{ 500 \mu L }$ of PBS to the mortar and muddled together with fungus sample to create a homogenous mixture of Penicillium Notatum and PBS. Placed three discs and let it saturated with the fungal extract mix.

Acquired a [[Luria Bertani]] agar plate and labelled the gel side with "Penicillium Notatum/LB/PC/09/26/23/BIOL 140A". Using a p200 pipette, transferred $\ce{ 100 \mu L }$ of E. Coli to agar plate, keeping lid minimally open and performed streak plate method. Added three paper discs saturated with fungal extract and one disc saturated with tap water evenly around the agar plate away from the center. Marked the water disc on the gel side of plate to identify negative control water disc. Jennifer L. added one control disc of tetracycline to the middle of agar plate.

Parafilmed agar plate and submitted to Jennifer to be placed in incubator at $\ce{ 37^oC }$ for about 48 hours. 

## Part II: Documented Growth of Sample after Incubation

09/28/2023
Placed agar plate sample over black construction paper and took photo with Google Pixel 7a at automatic settings.

# Results

![[Fungi Experiment.jpeg|500]]

**Figure 1:** LB Agar plate with Penicillium Notatum fungal extract and E. coli after about 48 hours of incubation at $37^oC$. Center disc is Tetracycline (+Control), Top left disc is Water (-Control), and all other discs saturated with fungal extract.

There is a prominent zone of death around the Tetracycline, with a consistent radius. About half of the visible e. coli growth is uniform and the other half is streaky, which is the water control is present, but the streakiness continues to the lower left fungal extract disc. Over all color of E. coli growth is a translucent and unsaturated green, which clearly declines the closer it is towards the tetracycline control.

# Discussion

Based on the controlled discs of the agar plate the only substance with antibiotic properties is Tetracycline, a known and proven antibiotic for fighting bacteria. If Penicillium Notatum had antibiotic properties, it would have ceased any bacterial growth around the fungal extract growth. It seems that Penicillium Notatum might encourage growth based off the uniform grow of E. Coli on the lower right disc of **Figure 1**, but more tests can be performed to confirm. There are very subtle clean outlines around the bottom right fungal extract disc, maybe implying there is some sort of antibacterial property, but a very weak scale. It could also mean that PBS Fungal extract washed away media, preventing bacteria to eat consume it. Penicillium Notatum fungus does not contain clear antibiotic properties against e. coli. 

# Conclusion

Penicillium Notatum does not contain any clear evidence of antibiotic properties comparable to Tetracycline, but more experiments need to be performed to confirm if it is effective to other organisms. Based of personal knowledge, it is still unknown how other bacteria or other organisms can react to penicillium notatum, and would consider other tests to check results. In terms of finding antibiotic properties, different bacterial samples would need to be tested. There are vast amounts of mold and fungus that can be tested and potentially might have similar effects of tetracycline.
