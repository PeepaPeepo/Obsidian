[[Phospholipids]] are a types of [[Lipids]] that are a major part of [[Cells]] [[Membranes]]. It is made up of [[Glycerol]] [[Ester Linkages|esterified]] with only two [[Fatty Acids]], and can be either [[Unsaturated Fatty Acids]] or [[Saturated Fatty Acids]]. The unoccupied [[Hydroxyl Groups]] is attached to a [[Phosphate Groups]], thus creating the naming scheme of [[Phospholipids]]. 

The natural negative charge from the $\ce{ - OPO_{3}- }$ gives phospholipids a negative charge. The negative charge naturally connects to a complimentary [[Ions|ionized]] [[Molecules]] or [[Atoms]]. The tails of phospholipids are [[Hydrophobic]] like normal [[Fats|Triglycerides]], but the head containing the $\ce{ -OPO_{3}- }$ is [[Hydrophilic]]. When exposed to water, hydrophilic parts will separate the hydrophobic parts from water, forming a double layer sheet called [[Bilayers]].
