[[Brown Algae]] are the largest and most complex [[Multicellular Organisms|Multicelluar]] [[Algae]]. [[Carotenoids]] in [[Plastids]] produce the brown color. Most are marine and are commonly called seaweeds. Seaweeds have rootlike [[Holdfasts]] and stemlike [[Stipes]] which support the leaflike [[Blades]]. Some have floats to keep photosynthetic structures near the water surface. They lack true tissues and organs found in [[Kingdom Plantae|Plants]].

*[[Laminaria]]* is a species of brown algae that is eaten. [[Algin]] is a substance found in the cell walls that is used as thickener in food.

Kelp forests are important marine ecosystems.
