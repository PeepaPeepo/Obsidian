# Experiment 1 - Conductimetric Titration of $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$

# Purpose

$$\ce{ Ba(OH)2 (aq) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq)<=> BaSO_{4}(s) + 2 H_{2}O (l) }$$

Figure out concentration of unknown solution of $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ through the method of [[Conductimetric Titrations]], the zero point of [[Conductivity]] theoretically means that there are balanced amount of $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ and $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$.

Determine unknown concentration of $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ by analyzing its precipitate, $\ce{ BaSO_{4} }$.

# Concepts and Theories

## Precipitation Reactions

Some liquid reactants form a solid precipitate when combined, most can be predicted by referring to [[Solubility Rules]].

## Titrations

Titration can be used to find unknown concentrations of substances when given known reactions, such that some analytes change colors, or have high conductivity, at their end points when mixed with a stoichiometric (balanced) amount of reactants.

For this experiment, the equivalence point is observed with [[Conductivity]]. When there are low amounts of excess $\ce{ Ba+ }$ and $\ce{ OH- }$, the conductivity of the solution is high. When there are high amounts of excess, the conductivity is low. In this case, use the volume of titrant to convert to moles, then solve for $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$  with balanced equation.

Concentration of $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ can be found by analyzing the weight of the precipitate in the sense that Limiting reactant will most likely be $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ because there is an excess amount of $H_{2}SO_{4}$ that can be used. Weight can be converted in to moles of $\ce{ BaSO_{4} }$, then use the following balanced equation below to solve for our analyte.

$$\ce{ Ba(OH)2 (aq) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq)<=> BaSO_{4}(s) + 2 H_{2}O (l) }$$

# Materials and Methods

## Conductometric Titration

1. Using 100mL [[Graduated Cylinder]], measure 60mL of standardized solution of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ and transfer to a 100mL [[Beaker]]. Record concentration of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$. 
2. Using a small portion of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$, condition and flush a 25 mL [[Burette]] to rid of any contaminants. Mount the burette onto ring stand and Fill burette with $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ to the 0.00 mark, if lesser, record exact amount. Set up a large waste beaker to the side and label for future use.
3. Acquire [[Vernier Unit]] and [[Conductivity Probe]], charge the base unit, turn it on, then connect probe. Change measurement units on the probe to microsiemens/cm or $\ce{ \mu S/cm }$
4. Using a [[Volumetric Pipet]] transfer 10.00 mL of unknown $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ into a 250 mL beaker, and dilute carefully with 50 mL of distilled $\ce{ H_{2}O }$. Mix with magnetic stir plate and bar. Do not splash.
5. Mount conductivity probe into unknown solution with [[Utility Clamp]] in a place that it doesn't make contact with stir bar, or [[Titrants]]
6. Make table in note book to record data,  Volume of $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ and measured conductivity.
7. Titrate unknown $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ with $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ in the burette
	1. Add $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ in increments of 1.0 mL to beaker and record conductivity at stable value and volume by 2 decimals
	2. Repeat until conductivity is less than 200 $\ce{ \frac{\mu S}{cm} }$, be sure to record data every step
	3. After conductivity is less than 200 $\ce{ \frac{\mu S}{cm} }$, add 0.50 mL of titrant and record data
	4. Begin adding increments of 0.1 mL and record data with every addition. Continue until conductivity is above 100 $\ce{ \frac{\mu S}{cm} }$. Note that its very difficult to achieve perfect equivalence point
	5. Switch back to 1.0 mL increments of titrant until conductivity is above 1000 $\ce{ \frac{\mu S}{cm} }$ and there are at least 4 mL additions of acid or reach the 20.00 mL mark on burette.
8. Keep byproduct because the [[Precipitates]] will be analyzed

## Filtration of the Precipitates

1. Warm beaker with finished titration on hot plate for 5 - 10 minute to "flocculate" or clump the precipitate. Let it cool to touch before filtration.
2. Set up ring stand and utility clamp for a vacuum flask setup. Include [[Buchner Funnel]] and vacuum tubing  
3. Obtain, weigh, and label paper filter for Buchner flask
4. Place and condition filter paper in funnel with distilled $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ 
5. Filter mixture then clean precipitate with distilled water about three times.
6. Transfer paper and sample to watch glass and dry under heat lamp
7. Weigh everything after dry
8. Dispose solid in solid and heavy metal waste
9. Dispose liquid in the vacuum flask in heavy metal waste

# Notes 

The following notes were made when reading the lab manual.

Barium Hydroxide and Sulfuric Acid forms [[Precipitation Reactions]]
Concentration of $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ through observing equivalence point of [[Conductimetric Titrations]] 
[[Equivalence Points]] of [[Titration]] is the [[Stoichiometry|Stoichiometrically]] equivalent amount of [[Analytes]], and the reaction completes

$\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ needs enough $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$ to fully perform the [[Precipitation Reactions]]
There are excess $\ce{ Ba(OH)2 }$ ions and eventually will hit a point where there is a perfect stoichiometric amount

[[Conductimetric Titrations]] measures how well [[Substances]] or [[Solutions]] allow electricity to pass through 
Use a [[Conductivity Probe]] creates [[Circuits]] with itself and substances
Unit of [[Conductivity]] is [[Siemens]] per Meter or Microsiemens

Conductivity changes through out titration
Concentration of ions are theoretically very low at the equivalence point
