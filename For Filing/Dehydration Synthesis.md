- When two [[Monomers]], each contain a separate [[Hydrogen]] and [[Hydroxyl Groups]] group, they can bond via [[Dehydration Synthesis]], a subset of [[Condensation Reactions]]
- The Hydrogen and [[Hydroxyl Groups]] merge and break off as a water [[Molecules]] therefore [[Condensation Reactions|condensing]]
- The opposite of [[Dehydration Synthesis]] and [[Condensation Reactions]] are typically [[Hydrolysis]] reactions
