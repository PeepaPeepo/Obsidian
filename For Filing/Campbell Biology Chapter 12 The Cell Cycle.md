# Concept 12.1 Most Cell Divisions Result in Genetically identical daughter cells

[[Cell Division]]

## Key Roles of Cell Division

[[Cell Division]] functions in renewal and repair of eukaryotes

## Cellular Organization of the Genetic Material

Genetic information is [[Genomes]]
[[Chromosomes]] consist of one long DNA with other proteins
The building materia of chromosomes are called [[Chromatin]]
[[Somatic Cells]] are cells that arent reproductive and it contains 46 chromosomes
made in two sets
Reproductive cells are [[Gametes]] such as sperm and eggs, they contain half the amount of chromosomes in gametes 

# Distribution of Chromosomes Durign Eukarytoic Cell Division

[[Chromosomes]] are in the form of [[Chromatin]] when not dividing
[[Chromosomes]] condense as part of [[Cell Division]]
[[Sister Chromatids]] joined copies of original chromosomes
They are joined together by [[Cohesins]] and that is called [[Sister Chromatid Cohesion]]
Each sister chromatid has a [[Centromeres]] a region made up of repetitive sequences in chromosomal DNA

# 12 Chapter Review


## Concept 12.1 Most cell division results in genetically identical daughter cells pp 235-237

[[Cell Division]] unicellular organisms reproduce through this, multicellular use it for development from fertilized egg and growth and repair

Genetic material of a cell is [[Genomes]], found within [[Chromosomes]].
[[Chromosomes]] consists of DNA molecule and other proteins. Complex of DNA and proteins are called [[Chromatin]]. Depending on stage of division its either diffused or compact.

[[Gametes]] are sex cells and contain one set of chromosomes, [[Somatic Cells]] are everything else and has two.

[[Cells]] replicate [[Chromatin]] first before making two [[Daughter Cells]]. [[Chromosomes]] are duplicated and consists of [[Sister Chromatids]] joined through [[Sister Chromatid Cohesion]]. [[Centromeres]] clutch them at their midpoints. [[Sister Chromatid Cohesion]] breaks and separates the [[Chromosomes]] of daughter cells.

[[Mitosis]] is the division of the [[Cell Nucleus]]
[[Cytokinesis]] is division of [[Cytoplasm]].

[[Chromosomes]] are structures of packaged [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]], each containing 100-1000 genes
[[Somatic Cells]] contain 46 [[Chromosomes]], 23 from each Parent
[[Gametes]] contain 23 [[Chromosomes]]

## Distribution of Chromosomes

After [[DNA Replication]] the [[Chromosomes]] condense
Duplicated chromosomes exists as [[Sister Chromatids]] bonded through [[Sister Chromatid Cohesion]] and a [[Centromeres]]

[[Gametes]] are produced through [[Meiosis]]
[[Fertilization]] completes the set of [[Chromosomes]]

[[Mitosis]] conserves a complete set of 46 

## Concept 12.2 The mitotic phase alternates with interphase in the cell cycle pp 237-244

[[Cell Division]] is part of [[Cell Cycle]], an ordered sequence of events
==Between [[Cell Division]] is [[Interphase]]
	[[Gap 1 Phase]]
	[[Synthesis Phase]] - DNA Synthesis
	[[Growth 2 Phase]]
	[[Mitotic Phase]] - [[Mitosis]] and [[Cytokinesis]]==
[[Mitotic Spindle]] is made of [[Microtubules]] and controls [[Chromosomes]] movement during [[Mitosis]], it arises from [[Centrosomes]]. It includes a spindle of [[Microtubules]] and [[Asters]]
It can attach to [[Kinetochores]] of [[Chromosomes]] and bring it to [[Metaphase Plate]]

[[Sister Chromatids]] separate and [[Motor Proteins]] move along [[Kinetochores]] [[Microtubules]] to opposite sides of the [[Cells]]. The [[Cells]] elongate whne [[Motor Proteins]] push non [[Kinetochores]] microtubles from opposite poles

[[Mitosis]] is followed by [[Cytokinesis]] through [[Cleavage]]
[[Binary Fission]] 

### Phases of the Cell Cycle

[[Mitotic Phase]] includes [[Mitosis]] and [[Cytokinesis]] and is the shortest part of the [[Cell Cycle]]
[[Interphase]] is everything that isn't [[Mitotic Phase]]
	[[Gap 1 Phase]] - Cell Growth 
	[[Synthesis Phase]] - Chromosome duplication
	[[Growth 2 Phase]] - Complete preparation for division
	Each phase produces proteins and cytoplasmic organelles such  as mitochondria and ER

[[Mitotic Phase]]
	[[Mitosis]]
		[[Prophase]]
		[[Prometaphase]]
		[[Metaphase]]
		[[Anaphase]]
		[[Telophase]]
	[[Cytokinesis]]
[[Interphase]]
	[[Gap 1 Phase]] - Cell Growth 
	[[Synthesis Phase]] - Chromosome duplication
	[[Growth 2 Phase]] - Complete preparation for division
## Concept 12.3 The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle is regulated by a molecular control system pp 244-250

[[Signaling Molecules]] in [[Cytoplasm]] regulate progress
[[Cell Cycle Control System]], cyclin changes in regulatory proteins including [[Cyclins]] and [[Cyclin-Dependent Kinases]] works like a clock.

==[[Cell Cycle]] stops at specific [[Checkpoints]] until trigger signals received, important checkpoints are in [[Gap 1 Phase]], [[Growth 2 Phase]] and [[Mitotic Phase]]. Internal and external signals control the check points through [[Signal Transduction]].==

[[Density-Dependent Inhibition]] vs [[Anchorage Dependence]]
Cancer cells do not follow normal cell cycle and divide unchecked. [[Malignant Tumors]] invade nearby tissues and go through [[Metastasis]]

[[Cell Cycle Control System]] a cyclically operating set of molecules in he cell that both triggers and coordinates key events in the cell cycle

[[Checkpoints]] trigger events and are found in [[Gap 1 Phase]], [[Growth 2 Phase]], and [[Mitotic Phase]]

### The Cell Cycle Clock: Cyclins and Cyclin Dependent Kinases

[[Cyclins]] are proteins because of teh cyclically change in concentration
[[Cyclin-Dependent Kinases]] activity is based on [[Cyclins]] concentration
[[Maturation-Promoting Factor]] react to cyclin concentration, think of M phase promoting factor
Cyclin increases during [[Synthesis Phase]] and [[Growth 2 Phase]]
It triggers cells passage into m phase past the G2 checkpoint

[[Growth 0 Phase]] no start signals active

[[Growth Factors]] are proteins released by certain cells that stimulate other cells to divide 

[[Density-Dependent Inhibition]] crowded cells stop dividing
[[Anchorage Dependence]] must be attached to something to grow
