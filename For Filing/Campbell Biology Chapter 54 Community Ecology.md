[[Community Structure]] is the number of species found in a community, are present, and the relative abundance of them

# Concept 54.1 Interactions Between Species can help, harm, or have no effect on the individuals involved

Interactions of organisms with other individuals of another species in the community are [[Interspecific Interactions]]. It can include competition, predation, herbivory, parasitism, mutualism, and commensalism
Positive or negative effects 
Predation is a +/- interaction
Mutualism is a +/+ interaction

## Competition

-/- interaction, individuals of different species each use a resources that limits survival and reproduction of both individuals
Can occur within members of same species
Which can be called intraspecific competition

## Competitive Exclusion

Tow species whose members compete for same resource cannot coexist permanently in same place
Elimination of inferior competitor is called [[Competitive Exclusion]]

## Ecological Niches and Natural Selection

[[Ecological Niche]] is the specific set of biotic and abiotic resources that an organism uses in its [[Environments]]
Niche of tropical tree lizard includes temperature range, size of branches it perches, time of day its active, and sizes and kinds of insects it eats
Ecologically similar species can coexist in a community
Differentiation of niches that enables similar species to coexist in a community is called [[Resource Partitioning]]
[[Fundamental Niche]] is potentialyl occupied by that species is different from from [[Realized Niche]]
The niche it actually occupies

## Character Displacement

Tendency for characteristics to diverge more in sympatric than allopatric populations of two species is called [[Character Displacement]]

## Exploitation

[[Exploitation]] is an +/- interaction where individuals of one species benefit by feed on individuals of another
This includes [[Predation]], [[Herbivory]], and [[Parasitism]]

### Predation

[[Predation]] is a +/- interaction where individuals kills and eats an individual of another species, the [[Prey]]
