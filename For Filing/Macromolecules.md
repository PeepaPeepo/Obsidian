- The major [[Macromolecules]] are formed by [[Polymers]] which are made up single units of [[Monomers]]
- [[Polymers]] are chainlike units formed of [[Monomers]]
- Chemical mechanism for forming and breaking [[Polymers]] is [[Polymerization]] and is facilitated by [[Enzymatic Proteins]] which are typically [[Proteins]]
- Polymer linkage is formed by [[Dehydration Synthesis]], a subset of [[Condensation Reactions]] which take away an $H_{2}O$ between two [[Monomers]]' [[Hydroxyl Groups]] and Hydrogen
- Breaking of [[Polymers]] are caused by [[Hydrolysis]], which uses water to 'rehydrate' and separate bonds
- Each class have different names for their [[Monomers]] and [[Polymers]]
- [[Macromolecules]] can only be used when broken down into [[Monomers]]
- The major [[Macromolecules]] include [[Carbohydrates]], [[Proteins]], and [[Nucleic Acids]]; [[Lipids]] technically don't count as a macromolecule
