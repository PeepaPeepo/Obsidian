[[Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)]] refers to resistance of blood flow within blood vessels, there are two primary factors that influence it. **Diameter** of [[Blood Vessels]] and the [[Viscosity]] of the [[Blood]].

Resistance, R of SVR, is inversely related to diameter because as diameter shrinks, resistance increases.
