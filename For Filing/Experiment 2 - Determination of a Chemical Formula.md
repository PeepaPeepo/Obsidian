# Overview

- [[Molecular Formulas]] gives all atoms that make up a [[Molecules]]
- [[Empirical Formulas]] have the numbers of atoms reduced to the the smallest [[Whole Numbers]] [[Ratios]]s
- Many laboratory techniques only yield empirical formula, and not the molecular formula
- [[Experiment]] is to determine the empirical formula of an unknown copper chloride [[Compounds|compound]]
$$Cu_{x}Cl_{y} \cdot Z\ H_{2}O$$
- $x$, $y$, and $z$ are integers
- [[Ionic Compounds]] with intact water [[Molecules]]s in its formula unit is a [[Hydrate]]
- Intact waters are written using [[Dot Notation]]
- Waters are weakly bound and removed with heating
- Hydrate format
	- $M_mX_n \cdot z H_2O$
		- Dot represents weak chemical bond that entrains the water molecules into the crystal lattice structure of the compound
	- X is anything at the top right of the periodic
	- X bonds ionically to metal
	- M is typically a metal
- Goal is to determine x, y, and z
- start with hydrate (blue green)

$$Cu_{x}Cl_{y}*z\ H_{2}O+heat \to Cu_{x}Cl_{y}+z\ H_{2}O$$
$$Hydrate, blue green \to Anhydrous, brown$$

- The result is the [[Anhydrous Form]]
	- Anhydrous compound
	- Transition to brownish color
- Removal of water is accompanied by color change
- Copper [[Ions]] are blue-green color in the presence of water
- Then brown with the absence of water
- Analysis Process
	- Determine quantity of water by heating the hydrate to drive off water
	- The quantity of water is the change in [[Mass]] before and after heating
	- Re-dissolve the anhydrous solid in water and react with aluminum metal
	- Reaction is a [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]]
	- Aluminum dissolves in solution, copper deposits as solid metals that can be filtered out and measured

# Experimental Procedure

- 2 Main Parts
	- Part I will determine the moles of water present in the [[Hydrate]]
		- Heat and drive off water
		- Calculate from mass difference the mole of water
	- Part II will determine moles of copper present in the solid
	- Moles of chloride will be determined by difference and the empirical formula can be determined

## Part I Determining the Moles of Water

- Weigh a clean [[Crucible]] without its cover on [[Analytical Scale]]
- Add 1 g of unknown to crucible and weigh
	- Unknown should be in hydrated form
	- Blue-green color
- Heat the unknown in the crucible with [[Bunsen Burner]] using a small blue flame making contact with crucible
	- Continue heating until unknown turns brown, anhydrous form
	- Gently heat for another 1 to 2 minutes until unknown is completely brown
- Cover crucible with lid and let cool for 15 minutes, check contents to see if everything is completely brown
- Weigh uncovered crucible and contents, calculate mass of anhydrous unknown
- Calculate the mass and [[Moles]] of water based on the amount of mass lost when sample was heated
	- Moles = mass of water/18.02g/molar mass of water 
	- calculate molar mass
		- 1 $O$
		- $H_2$ 
		- The sum of the individual molar masses of the atoms of elements

## Part II Determining the moles of copper

- Transfer anhydrous unknown from the crucible to a clean 50 mL [[Beaker]]
- Rinse out crucible with two 5 - 7 mL portions of distilled water and add rinse to beaker
	- Water measured from graduated cylinder
	- Gently swirl the beaker to dissolve the brown solid
- Obtain a length of **Aluminum Wire** 
	- Form a loose coil
	- Immerse wire in solution
	- Gas bubbles should form
	- Solid copper will deposit on the wire
	- Use glass stirring rod to scrape solid copper off
	- Reaction will take about 30 minutes
	- Blue green color will fade
	- Why?
- Add 5 drops of 6 M HCl^2
	- Using glass stirring rod
	- scrape off as much solid copper back into the beaker
	- Rinse off any loose copper with distilled water
	- Add rinse to beaker
	- A drop or two of 6 M HCl can be directly placed on wire to clean copper
	- Weigh a clean dry piece of filter on analytical balance
	- Clamp filter flask to iron stand with utility clamp
	- Fit filter paper into Buchner Funnel and separate the solid copper by [[Vacuum Filtration]]
		- Wet filter paper with distilled water to ensure a good seal
		- Rinse any copper into the beaker into the funnel with water
		- Rinse copper in funnel thoroughly
	- Turn off vacuum and add 10 mL 95% ethanol to funnel and let sit for about a minute
	- Turn vacuum back on and filter for 5 minutes
	- Why Ethanol?
	- Remove filter paper and copper with a metal spatula and set them on a watch glass
	- Dry under heat lamp for 5 minutes
	- Remove filter paper and copper from the heat lamp and let cool to room temp
	- weight filter paper and copper
	- calculate mass and moles of copper
		- Mass of copper * Molar Mass Unit from periodic table
- Mass of chloride by difference = mass of hydrated sample - (mass of copper + mass of water)
- Moles of chloride = mass of chloride/35.45 g/mol
- Empirical formula is the lowest ration
- Molecular formula is also the empirical
- x, y, z, = will be equal to the mols of each unit
	- Divide the lowest mol amount to find empirical form
	- 

# Calculation and Discussion

The mass of unknown hydrate consists entirely of Cu, Cl, and H_2O

$$mass\ of\ Cu + mass\ of\ Cl + mass\ of\ H_{2}O = mass\ of\ hydrate$$
