The [[Electronegativity]] of an [[Elements]] determines how strongly it attracts other [[Electrons]]. In the context of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]], electronegative is highest at the top right, and decreases in value going towards the bottom left with a few exceptions. 

- Attraction of a particular atom for the [[Electrons|electrons]] of [[Covalent Bonds]]
- The more electronegative an [[Atoms|atom]] is, the stronger it pulls the shared electron
	- Analogous to satellites a planet
- In covalent bonds of two of a kind atoms, electrons are shared equally
- They have the same electronegativity
- This neutral electronegativity is a [[Nonpolar Covalent Bond]]
- When an atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the electrons of the bond is not shared equally, known as a [[Polar Covalent Bonds]]
- Oxygen is one the most electronegative elements
- Because electrons have $\delta -$ charges and are pulled into towards O in a water molecule, the oxygen atom has partial negative charges and H has $\delta +$
- In the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]], [[Elements|Elements]] from left to right increase in electronegativity
- Left of the table are called [[Electropositive]] elements
- $F>O>N>C$ is an important property
- Electronegativities decrease from top to bottom
- $F>Cl>Br>I$
- The more [[Valence Electrons]] and Atom has, the more it wants to gain an electron to become stable
- Valence electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus, decreasing the atomic radius
- Protons can exert a stronger force on the valence electrons
- When a new shell exists in an atom, there is a further distance preventing proton to attract other electrons

# Questions

## What determines an atom's electronegativity?

- "ElectronegativityÂ is a measure of the attraction of an atom for bonding electrons in molecules compared to that of other atoms."
- Devised by [[Linus Pauling]], and American Chemist
- dimensionless quantities that range from slightly less than one for [[Alkali Metals]] to a maximum of four for [[Fluorine]]
- High electronegativity values attract electrons more than low values

## What determines the assignment of $\delta -$ and $\delta +$ for atoms?
