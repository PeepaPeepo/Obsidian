[[Mark Banning]] was my guitar teacher around 6 - 8th grade, ~2008 - 2010. First ever guitar teacher I had, and it was at a [[Hayward Music Center]] in front of [[Southland Mall]]. He taught me [[Chords]], [[Scales]], and [[Modes]] because I really wanted to learn improv and jazz like Kuya Ronald.

First song I was successfully able to play was [[Green Day]]'s Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)
I was wearing large black plastic glasses.

I was in a small class of about 4 - 5, and I was able to keep up.

I asked him to teach me improv and what not, and I think he was really excited. He taught be the basic blues scale, and the 3 boxes of it. How to bend. He used to play around with harmonicas and slide picks. 

He recognized that I was putting in effort. He offered to teach his place and record sometimes

I only went to his house in Castro Valley once for some reason related to lessons.

I remember he would always be on time to class, on the dot. 

He was a really cool guy.

He used to play unofficially or auditioned for the red hot chili pepper.

I really wished I learned from him more.

Today was the day I found out he passed when I googled him.

I reached out to him maybe around 2019,right before or covid happened. I reached out to him via his website, and he replied. I was surprised he remembered me, but I never followed up cause i wanted in person lessons. I feel bad I never replied, and I wished we got to talk more. 

I hope he rests in peace.
