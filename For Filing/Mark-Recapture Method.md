# Application

To count hard to track [[Organisms]] that can hide or move frequently

# Technique

Scientists capture an initial sample and mark them, or record and recognize unique features of individuals
They are released back into their [[Populations]] for a few weeks or days
A second sample is made and notes how many were marked from initial sample
The number of marked animals capture in the second sampling divided by the total number of animals captures in the second sampling should be equal to number of individuals marked and released in the first samplings divided by the estimated population size.

$$\ce{ \frac{x}{n} = \frac{s}{N} }$$

$$\ce{ N = \frac{sn}{x} }$$

x = number of marked animals captured in second sampling
n = total number of animals captured in second sampling
s = number of individuals marked and released in first sample
N = estimated population size
