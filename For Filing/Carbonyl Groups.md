[[Carbonyl Groups]] are [[Functional Groups]] that is made of carbon double bonded to an oxygen. It has [[Electrophile|Electrophilic]] characteristics from resonance and induction.

This is foundational reasoning for why [[Nucleophiles]] "attack between the legs."

$$\ce{ :C=O }$$

- A [[Functional Groups|functional group]] where a [[Carbon]] is [[Double Covalent Bonds|double bonded]] to an [[Oxygen]]
- Depending on placement of $\ce{ :C=O }$, it can form a [[Ketones]] or an [[Aldehydes]]
	- If The Carbonyl Group was placed within a [[Carbon Skeletons|carbon skeleton]] it forms a Ketone
	- If The Carbonyl Group was placed at the end of a [[Carbon Skeletons|carbon skeleton]] it forms a Aldehyde
- [[Sugars]] can contain either ketones or aldehydes are called [[Ketoses]] and [[Aldoses]] respectively 


# Examples

- [[Acetone]]
- [[Propanal]]
