[[DNA Isolations]] including the purpose of all its reagents (chemicals)
	[[Phosphate-buffered saline]] ([[Phosphate-buffered saline|PBS]])
	[[Proteinase K]]
	[[Buffer AL]] is a lysis buffer
	[[Ethanol]]
	[[Lysate]] a fluid that contains lysed cells
	[[DNeasy Mini Spin Column]] used in purifying DNA
	[[AW1 Buffer]] is a washing agent to clean DNA in spin column
	[[AW2 Buffer]]
	[[Buffer AE]] to elute dna

NanoDrop spectrophotometry
	Pure DNA is a 260/280 ratio of 1.8 - 2.0
	Absorbs UV light that pass through bases at wavelength 260nm
	Concentration is quantity of dna in the supplied volume, $\ce{ 2\mu L }$ 


[[Polymerase Chain Reactions]] including the purpose of all its reagents (chemicals)
	Amplifies specific parts in genome
	[[Denaturation]] denature strands
	[[Annealing]] Primers bind to complementary sequences (very specific to target parts of genome)
	[[Extension]] [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase III|DNA Pol III]] builds it out and extends sequence
	[[ProMega 2X PCR Master Mix]] contains dNMPs and buffers
	Ultra Pure Water
	Pure DNA
	Forward or Reverse Primers
		Goes in both directions to build complementary strands from the denatured DNA


[[Agarose Gel Electrophoresis]] including the purpose of all its reagents (chemicals)
	Separates [[Nucleic Acids]] by size
	[[Molecular Weight Marker]] 
	[[Loading Dye]] makes it fluorece in uv light
	Samples
	[[Agarose Powder]] a polysachharide made from seaweed, very good material to let molecules migrate through it
	[[GelRed]]
	DNA is negatively charged

[[Chromosomes]]
	DNA and Protein coiled around histones
	Is composed of [[Genes]]
		Genes are specific parts of DNA that codes for functional proteins
[[Alleles]] 
	Different versions of a gene at the genomic location
	A varient of a sequence at a specific loci on dna

[[Loci]]
	Specific Part of [[Chromosomes]]

[[Genomes]]
	Entire sequence of nucleotides in the DNA of a chromosome

[[Genotypes]]
	Complete set of alleles
[[Homozygous]] 
	Two alleles that are inherited are the same

[[Hetereozygous]]
	Not the same

[[DNA Sequence Analysis]]
	[[Flanks]]
	[[Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms]]

[[Agarose Gel Electrophoresis]] troubleshooting and analysis

[[Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9 System|CRISPR-Cas9 System]]
