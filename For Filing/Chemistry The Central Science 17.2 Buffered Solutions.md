[[Buffers]] are [[Solutions]] that maintain a relatively constant [[Potential of Hydrogen|pH]] when a [[Acids]] or [[Bases]] are added

# The Common Ion Effect: Weak Acids Combined with Conjugate Bases

[[Equilibrium Constant Expression]] of Acetic acid and salt buffer

$\ce{ K_{a} = \frac{[H+][CH_{3}COO-]}{[CH_{3}CO_{2}H]} }$

Sodium acetate $\ce{ CH_{3}CO_{2}Na }$ is a strong electrolyte that ionizes completely
$\ce{ Na+ }$ counts as [[Spectator Ions]] in this equation

0.150 M Solution of formic acid at 25 C, pKA = 3.75 has a pH of 2.28 is 3.5% Ionized
