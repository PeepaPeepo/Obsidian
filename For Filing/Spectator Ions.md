[[Spectator Ions]] appear unchanged in some [[Complete Ionic Equations]] because they do not participate in some reactions. In this case [[Spectator Ions]] can be removed to convert [[Complete Ionic Equations]] into [[Net Ionic Equations]].

If [[Aqueous Solutions]] produce some sort of s, g, or l then they are not spectator ions.
