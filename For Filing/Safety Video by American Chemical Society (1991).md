# Handling Chemicals

Handling chemicals with care and precision is necessary in the lab to maintain safety. Always transfer stock chemicals to smaller containers that can be easily controlled. Wait for the instructors directions before mixing che micals. Double check and read labels of chemicals. Do not add water to acid because it can cause an exothermic reaction and splash. Pouring chemicals can be guided by using a stirring rod. Work trays are another layer of safety to contain spills. 

Stoppers of any chemical storage should be held between fingers to prevent contamination; always close the storage after use. Never pour back into stock bottles to prevent contamination. Dispose chemicals in appropriate containers. Use pipette bulbs and never mouthes. Report spills immediately and let teach clean it up. Spills can be controlled with absorbent substances. Do not dispose chemicals in sink unless approved. Dispose broken glass in broken glass container. Clean up work space, clean and scrub glassware, and wipe remaining table with towels; they should be disposed according to chemical that was cleaned.

# Bunsen Burner Safety

Never heat volatile liquids with bunsen burner, they should be heated with heat mantle or steam bath under fume hood. There are different types of bunsen burners but contain similar features:, gas outlet to burner, gas control valve, air inlet for oxygen, and wing top to spread flame. Check gas hose for cracks. Light the burner from the side with striker or matches. Yellow flams are too cool; add air to increase energy until blue. Adjust height of flame with gas valve if too big. If flame sputters, flame goes out, or if smell of gas is detected turn off gas. Cracks in glassware is bad and should not be used. Flat bottom container uses a wire screen on ring stand, and narrow necked should use clamps. Test tubes should use hot water bath or directly over flame; aim away from others. Always have openings to vent out vapor. Hold glass ware with beaker tong or gloves, and handle everything as if hot.

# Thermometer Safety

Thermometers do not need to be shaken to be used. Alcohol and mercury should not measure bunsen burner temperatures, lower ranges is necessary to prevent explosions of instrument. Lay on wire screen to prevent it from rolling. Teacher will clean up broken thermometer. Mercury is poisonous, mercury clean up kit will be used. 

# Glass Tubing Safety

Use glass tubing inserter and lube, like glycerin, to guide tubing into shaft. Always wash lubricant and replace tip. If no inserter is available, lubricate tubing and use leather gloves.

# Centrifuge Safety

Always balance centrifuge, water can be used on the opposite sides of samples to balance. Never stop centrifuge with hand.

# Dressing for Safety

No loose sleeves, Fuzzy sweaters are flammable, and polyester melts onto the skin.
Fitted cotton and wool is advised. Aprons keeps splashes away. Long pants or skirts to compensate for the length of apron. Always closed leather shoes, absorbent shoes can trap chemicals. Tie up long loose hair. Remove rings and watches, it can trap chemicals as well. No contact lenses during lab, it can capture vapors. Googles with side shields is advised. Always wear appropriate gloves. 

# Behavior in lab

No fooling around and no running. Move instruments to you to your eye level, and not self to the instrument. Make up can contaminated so avoid use in lab. Always finish food or drink before lab.

# Emergency Equipment

Wash cuts and dry it well for bandage. Notify teachers and get medical attention after.
During Eye wash, keep eyes open, and remove contacts if any are on. 
Rinse off chemicals off skin in sink with plenty of water. Go to safety shower and remove clothes
for at least 15 minutes if exposed to a lot of chemicals. Cover containers with watch glass to put out flames coming from glass wares. Larger fires use fire extinguisher. If fire is too large call 911 and mention chemicals involved. Use safety shower to extinguish self or stop drop and roll.
