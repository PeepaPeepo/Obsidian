# 08/20/2024 Lecture

[[Physiology]] is the study of normal function of a living organism and all of its parts
[[Integrative Science]] modular parts to form a whole
[[Endocrine Systems]]
Human Body systems include about 7 different
Examples include calcium integration
[[Thyroid Gland]]
[[Parathyroid]]
Regulates [[Calcium]] balance 
8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL
Endocrine system can produce [[Hormones]] [[Calcitonin]] that can stimulate bones, kidneys and intestines
Stimulates calcium deposition in bones
Reduce uptake in kidneys, they will excrete
Intestines reduced uptake/absorption

Organization and Hierarchy of life
Atom, molecule, macromolecule, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, organ system, organism
Organisms make up population in to species and community and ecosystem

Systems based on function
[[Circulatory Systems]]
Digestive
Endocrine
Immune
Integumentary
Musculoskeletal
Nervous
Reproductive
Respiratory
Urinary

## Cell to cell communication

[[Chemical Signaling]] wide spread and slow
[[Electrical Signaling]]
Distance: Cells in contact vs target cells far from signaling cell
Speed: ms to hours to days
![[Autocrine Signaling]]

![[Paracrine Signaling]]

![[Endocrine Signaling]]

![[Direct Signaling]]

Disruption of communication can lead to disorders of the nervous system
[[Multiple Sclerosis]] Myelin sheath that covers nerve fiber is damaged by MS which exposes nerve fiber

[[Strokes]] decrease blood flow in certain parts of the brain, due to high pressure or damage
[[Neurons]] are damaged from oxygen deprivation leads to excessive [[Glutamate]] neurotransmitter release and overstimulate adjacent neurons
Neurons are overexcited and damaged like membrane destruction leads to calcium exposures and causes unwanted reactions/response

Glucose homeostasis
Food breaks down in simple sugars
[[Beta Cells]] release insulin based on simple sugars in blood
Insuilin stimulates storage by liver, fat, and muscle cells

Diabetes type I, beta cells are damaged and insulin signal lost
Sugar accumulates to tooxic level in blood
Leads to kidney damaged, blindness, and cardiovascular diseases

[[Insulin]] stimulates absorption to reduce insulin 
[[Glucagon]] causes release of sugars or [[Glycogen]] in fat tissue into blood stream
Normal blood glucose levels: 4 - 6 mM
Diabetes type I is a autoimmune
Diabetes type II is not autoimmune

Structure and Function

[[Red Blood Cells]] are ~8 um
Flexible and shaped like Frisbee
Flexibility and shape allows travel through smallest blood vessels
Smallest Capillary diameter ~ 8-9 um
[[Sickle-Cell Disease]] that causes abnormal shape
Shape and forms optimize gas exchange

Structure and function related at all organization levels

Organ Level
2 Atria and 2 Ventricles in heart

[[Atrium]] chamber for receiving blood and atrial walls
Ventricles recieve blood and pump agwai from heart
[[Left Ventricle]] is the main driver that pumps blood from heart

## Information flow is important in physiology

Genetic information
[[Central Dogma of Molecular Biology]] DNA RNA Protein
Coordinates body function
Information flow can be large scale
Nerve endings on our fingers sense the heat
Signal is sent from fingers to nervous system in Spinal Cord
Spinal cord retunrs a signal to the arms and finger muscle to move away
Additional signals sent from nerve ending to cause pain sensation

## Homeostasis

[[Homeostasis]] maintains consisten environment in their bodies
Acceptable values for homeostasis
Resting heart beats 60-80 beats per minute
13-18 breathes per minute
Vitamin D blood level ~30-70 ng/mL
Human body temp 97-98.5
Testosterone in human male 300-1000 ng/dL
Daily activities can affect factors, but eventually returns to a set point

Blood Glucose Range
Homeostasis does not mean equilibrium
Intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations are different
K, Na, Cl, Ca
Want to maintain distinction
Movement of ions allow for signaling

[[Feedback Loops]]
Negative and Positive feedback loops
Result is to restore the normal state by negating that initial stimulus
Blood glcuose exmaple
	Release of chemicals to regulate or blunt the stimulus
	
![[Positive Feedback]] 

Examples include child brith
Initial stimulus is the stretched cervix
Response is uterin contractions
Contractions cause baby to stretch cervix more
Birth of baby is the factor needed to stop the loop

CLot formation followd by rupture of vessl is accelerated by the vicious cycle of thrombin formation

24. There are genetic variation of costal cartilage and connection of tenth pair of ribs, the false ribs.
25. Hyoid bone association with thyroid, and is suspended via cartilage around the area.

2. Atrophy of muscles from inactivity
4. Three types include skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles. Majority of organs are made of smooth muscle. Smooth muscles lack striations. 
4. Intercalated disks are found within cardiac cells, and enhance coordination
4. Smooth muscle is more omnidirectional that allows organs to move more dynamically 
4. More nuclei are found in the skeletal muscle and more mitochondria
5. Sartorious muscle is the longest muscle that flexes the hip; it allows rotation and abduction, it also flexes and externally rotates the knee. One cell can extend entirety of the muscle 
6. Skeletal muscles contain muscle tissue, connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves. Epimysium is a dense sheath made of collagen that surrounds one muscle. 
7. Muscle fascicle is like a rope with interwoven strands of muscle fibers. Perimysium is a fibrous layer that encapsulates fascicles. Primary blood vessels and nerves are found in perimysium to supply nutrients 
8. Skeletal muscles have limited amount of STEM cells
- Skeletal muscle development start with Myoblasts (Myo) that fuse and Myosatellite cell is introduce and the fusion leave leaves parent nuclei in the unit.
- Levels of organization starts with muscle fiber, fascicle, endomysium, perimysium, epimysium, and tendon; the tendon attaches muscles to parts of bones. 
- Inside the muscle fiber is a myofibril that are formed with sarcomeres, that expend across the cell
- Sacromeres range is from Z disk to Z Disks. It also has multiple bands
- Muscle cells have analogous terms as cells like sarcoplasm and Cytoplasm. The remaining parts are sarcoplasmic reticulum, sarcosome, and sarcolemma.
- Transverse tubules (T-Tubules) allow extracellular substances to get to intracellular structures. Sarcoplasmic reticulum contains calcium that is needed for muscle contraction and can get its supply via T-tubules
- Sacromeres are made with actin and myosin which are thick filaments. Their names are the reasons for A, M, I, H components. M line is like a male to male adapter that is formed with Myosin crossbridges. Actin connect Myo crossbridges to the z line of myofibril
- The H zone contains no overlap of myosin and actin filaments.
- M line components include two myosin heads that attach to ATP, and act. the head and tails are attached on a hinge region. The movement is like the smallest scale of a bicep curl
- Actin its like a twisted rope made of beads and is attached partyl to myosin heads.
- Calcium connects to troponin and triggers the binding sites of actin to change; the calcium is found in the sarconic retiulum
- Actin theory where it slides past myosin like a piston, binding of myosin heads do not occur all in unison, some heads need to release to execute sliding motion
- H zone is the segment with only myosin and no actin.
- Muscle contraction starts with binding of Calcium to troponin found on the myosin head. The myosin cocks the actin back like a pistol, and power stroke releases ADP. ATP completely lets go of myosin.
- Rigor is the empty site after ADP is released in low energy state
- Main is powerstroke, rigor, the reoccupation of ATP to get muscle in to ready position
- Rigor Mortis is the stiffing of a body because the lack of cellular respiration not supplying ATP that fills the rigor of muscle contraction
- Contraction is constantly happening minutely or not, but much less when at rest

- Macrophage destroy structures and foreign particles
- Bone Modeling occurs during early developmental stages where bone diameter increases where deeper lamellae are recycled and replaced with osteons
- Bone Remodeling is for maintenance and repair
- Bone remodeling maintains integrity and mineral homeostasis
- RANKL is a type of cytokine, chemical messenger for immune cells 
- Osteoblasts excrete RANKL and stimulates osteoclast activity 
- OPG is a decoy receptor and RANKL binds do it; it limits how many RANKL cytokines free floating to decrease activity
- Hyper and Hypocalcemia 
- Calcitonin tones down activity, stores calcium in bones
- Parathyroid Glands produce hormones to increase Calcium concentration
- Vitamin D is actually a hormone, Calcitriol because its effects happen in many organs with respective receptor
- Calcitriol affect Transcription Factors that affect gene expression are limited 
- Important Vitamin D receptors are in the intestines 
- Many Calcium channels in intestinal cell 
- Calbindin in cells
- Calcium pumped in to blood vessel
- VITAL Study states that the Vitamin D Supplements aren't very helpful
