# Quiz Review Notes

Aids can be characterized as 
	Pandemic

This concept is important for resource allocation for managing disease in a population
	C. Prevalence

Incidence is an important epidemiological measure
	D. Highlights the effectiveness or lack of prevention efforts
	Incidence is new cases

Which is true about life expectancy trends over time?
	African American rates have increased

The following are all reasonable uses of epidemiology except
	Developing health policies

Review Natural History of disease

Group: Justin, Lauren and Nou

## Final Project

Propose an idea with group, think of **health outcome**
Disease states or conditions that disease come from
Identify a specific **population that is affected by disease** 
	Population with shared characteristic
Getting the disease
Risk factor vs disease

City wide disease


Proposed outcome is the **Fentanyl addiction within homeless population (define homelessness) SF**

Asian is a made up category by non asians etc

Descriptive Epidemiology can make observations of a classroom, make an hypothesis and test if its true.

Data can be descriptive or analytic.

[[Epidemiological Variables]] 

Sources of Descriptive Data

Case series is just raw number of cases

Active and Passive Surveillance
Passive surveillance are happenstance reports that were weren't actively been looking for
Discovery of Aids: Case Series
5 cases of pneumocytsis
Antifungal medication
STD experts noted celluar immune dysfunction

**Weiss's Uterine Cancer Data**
Relatioship between women and hormone replacement therapy
Analytic epi finds that estrogen usage can lead to cancer

[[Person Variables]], characteristices, attributes, and behaviors of individuals
[[Place Variables]] area bout where people live and work
Socially progressive policies typically help everyone
[[Time Variables]] and its Curves

Ecological Slide
**Cigarette per capita anaylsis, countires that consume more have more cancer cases**
	cannot assume aggreate level can apply to individual level

[[Ecological Fallacy]] consists in thinking that association seen in aggregate holds true for individuals

[[Multilevel Analysis]] compares aggregate level vs individual level

## Chapter 3

Incidence vs Prevalence
Measuring Diseases frequency in closed population
US is considered as stationary, maybe
Denominators can be population size or person times
Populations must include people that can have the disease

Incidence only works on cohorts
Incidiecen proption interperation: average risk

Never leave data as raw decimal ratios, but actual percentage

**Incidence Rate**

Speed of events occur in a population
Low speed is ideal
Calculated differently in closed and open populations

[[Person-Time Unit]]
900 people at risk at 10 years
Number of women times years = 
$\frac{10}{9000 Year}$

Individual follow-up in a cohort
Cohorts can stagger person years
25 would stack with 50 py

Only cohort populations allow to do staggered person years

**Incidence Rate, Open Populations**

IR = onsets , avg population times duration of observation

**Shortcut**

Death rate assumed that everyone died by end of year
Assumtption that average was death at middle of year, 6 months
IR = 2.4 million divided by people times 1 year

People who didnt die - 2.4 Million who died times one year + 0.5 times 2.4 million

9/
(900 - 10 \* ==Full years 10==) + (0.5 \* 10)
IR = 0.01117
or 1.1% of 

3.2 Measure of Association

Exposure, E = explanatory factor or potential health detrminant
Disease, D = responce or outocme
Outcomes are depdendant variables
Lung Cancer depends on smoking
MEasure of Effect

Comparing 
Absolute difference is a greater risk of disease, [[Risk Difference]]
Comparing least exposed group to the other
[[Relative Risk]] 

Risk and Rate are interchangleb, but not the same 

RD = Risk difference 
naught sign bmeans risk rate associated with least exposed
$R_{1}$ risk rate associated with exposure
$R_{0}$

RD = R1 - R0
RR = R1/R0

RD = 0 when no effect of exposure on exposure
RR = 1

RD less than 0 means something is protective

RR = Less than one if exposure is protected
Harmful is greater 

Ro non exposted
r1 is exposred
Difference 

R0 gearter

5 More cases

$R_{1}$ Any value above 1 means there is a greater relative risk
Exposure = Fitness
D = Death

Compared to those who are not fit
Those are fit 
R0 = less than 0
Compared to this R group
There is xyz
Those unexpored
Expored have this amount

RD is good less than 0
RD is bad Greater than 0
Avoid - or positive talk,

RR is not effected when equals 1
Bad is greated than 1
Less than 1 

RD doesnt tell you how bad something is, only how many is affected
RR tells how good or bad it is 
RR values of 1.1 - 1.5 whatever, its not crazy
Epi people are concerned when RR is greater than 2
