[[Nucleotides]] are [[Monomers]] of [[Polynucleotides]], which form [[Macromolecules]] called [[Nucleic Acids]]. It is made of five-carbon [[Carbohydrates]] called a [[Pentoses]], [[Nucleobases]], and one to three [[Phosphate Groups]]. The first [[Monomers]] of [[Polypeptides]] have three [[Phosphate Groups|Phosphate Groups]] until it [[Polymerization|polymerizes]] with another, losing it's beta and gamma phosphate. [[Nucleotides]] without any phosphate are called [[Nucleosides]].


[[Nucleotides]] are made of the sugar, [[Ribose]] or [[Deoxyribose]]. The difference is the lack of oxygen attached to 2' in [[Deoxyribose]], where as it would be a [[Hydroxyl Groups]] in Ribose.

Connected to 1' carbon of the [[Pentoses]] is [[Nucleobases]], which can be [[Adenine]], [[Guanine]], [[Cytosine]], [[Thymine]], and [[Uracil]]. [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] can only use AGCT, and [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] can only use AGCU.

Connected to the 5' for the pentose is a chain of [[Phosphate Groups]] that can range from one to three, depending on situation.
