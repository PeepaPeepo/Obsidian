## Mitochondria

The [[Mitochondria]] is the power house of the cell. Its primary function is [[ATP]] production. The Mitochondria utilizes [[ATPases]] to break down ATP and use it as a source of energy. 

Not all cells have [[Mitochondria]], such as [[Sperms]], but sperms have [[Mitochondria]] at the base of the [[Flagella|Flagellum]] used as power source to flick dat tail. [[Sperms]] are tipped with [[Acrosomes]].

[[Eggs]] are known as [[Oocytes]], when sperm [[Vesiculation|Vesiclizes]] into it, it forms a [[Pronuclei]].

[[Mitochondria]] believed to originate from the mother cell called [[Mitochondrial Eve]], which MAYBE came from the [[Rickettsiae]] Family.

The mitochondria contains [[Cisternae]], [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]], and [[Mitochondrial Ribosomes|mtRibosomes]].
