# Chapter 1 The Chemical World

## 1.1 Sand and Water

- Atoms are small
- They make up a molecule when chemically bound
- Atoms in one grain of sand outnumber all grains of large beaches
- Atoms and how they form molecules 
## 1.2 Chemicals Compose Ordinary Things

- Understanding properties around us
- How do the particles behave
- Water Molecules
	- If they were different in any way
	- It would be a completely different behavior
## 1.3 The Scientific Method: How Scientists Think

- They use scientific method
- Composed of making observations, making hypotheses, experimenting, formulating laws and theories

### Observations

- Can be made with naked eyes or scientific measuring instruments 
- Measurements of descriptions of physical world

### Hypothesis

- Typically an unproven or tentative explanation of an observation

### Experimentation

- Highly controlled observations to prove or disprove hypotheses

### Scientific Laws 

- After collecting similar observations, it can be used to develop a scientific law 
- Summarization of previous observations to predict future ones

### Theories

- One or more established hypotheses can develop theories
- Provides deeper explanations for laws and observations
- Also known as Models

#### Example

- Atomic Theory
- By John Dalton
- Proposed everything is made of indestructible particles called atoms 
## 1.4 Analyzing and Interpreting Data

### Identify Patterns in data and interpret graphs

Its important to analyze and interpret scientific data

### Identifying Patterns in Data

- Helpful incases like figuring out chemical compositions
- Seeing patterns is a creative process that other scientists can miss

## 1.5 Beginning Chemist: How to Succeed

- Chemistry requires curiosity and imagination
- Want to understand the 'why' of things
- Quantification is important

# Review

## [[Introductory Chemistry Chapter 1]]

## Which statement about a hypothesis is TRUE?

It is part of the scientific method.
It is a tentative interpretation or explanation.
It has the potential to be proven wrong.
It can be tested by experiments.

## Which of the following is an example of an observation?

When a can of soda pop is opened, a fizzing sound is heard.

## Which of the following is an example of a scientific law?

In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed.

## How is chemistry connected to everyday life and how is it relevant outside the chemistry laboratory?   

Knowing some chemistry can help you make day-to-day decisions that affect your life.
All matter is made of chemicals.
Chemistry is not confined to a laboratory.
Many of the changes you observe in the world around you are caused by chemical reactions.

## Which of the following is the smallest particle of matter?

an atom of oxygen

## Chemists attempt to understand how ____ behaves, by studying the properties of ____.

matter, atoms and molecules

## Which of the following statements is correct?

All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.

## A single drop of soda contains how many atoms?

far greater than one trillion

## The following statements are true about water, but which one can be said about any substance? Water is a substance that ______.

is a chemical

## A good definition of chemistry is:

the science that seeks to understand what matter does by studying what atoms and molecules do.

## Which statement accurately describes the purpose of experiments?

Experiments look for other observable predictions of a theory.

## Which statement would NOT be an example of "quantification"?

The water in the swimming pool feels colder than it was yesterday.

## Which term best describes a brief statement that summarizes past observations and predicts future ones?

Law

## A student measures the volume of a gas sample at several different temperatures. The results are tabulated as follows:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Temperature of gas (KK)|Volume of gas (LL)|
|298|4.55|
|315|4.81|
|325|4.96|
|335|5.11|

The temperature of a gas is directly proportional to its volume.
The temperature-to-volume ratio of a gas is constant.

## You call one of your friends to go to a movie on Friday night. He declines your invitation, stating that he needs to study for his upcoming exam on Monday. He states that he scores higher on a exam when he studies for the exam. Despite your efforts to convince him to go to the movie, he stays at home to study for his exam. You decide to use the scientific method to test the hypothesis that students who study for an exam tend to score higher than students who do not study for an exam. In what order should you conduct the following steps to test your hypothesis?

Design Experiment
Collect Data
Analyze Data
Confirm and Revise Hypothesis

## Which of the following experiment setups would be the best way to test your hypothesis?

  
After the exam, give students a survey questioning their study habits and what grade they made on their exam.

## What was the average exam grade for each set of students?

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Exam grade|94|95|90|87|88|100|78|96|98|94|

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Exam grade|65|72|71|64|56|49|88|66|75|44|

92, 65

## In order to succeed in chemistry, a student must have which quality?

being curious

What was the world population in 1925?
What was the world population in 2000?
How much did the population increase between 1925 and 2000
What is the average rate of increase in population per year over this time (from 1925 to 2000)?
If the average rate of increase remains constant, estimate the world population in 2025, given the population in 2000 that you already calculated.
