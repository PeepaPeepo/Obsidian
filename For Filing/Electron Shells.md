- Layers of space surrounding an [[Atomic Nucleus]] that contains [[Electrons]]
- Classified in three shells: $s_1,\ s_2,\ and\ s_3$
- Each shell have a limit of electrons it can contain
	- $s_1$ can have 2 electrons 
	- $s_2$ can have 8 electrons with in the $s_{1},\ p_{x},\ p_{y},$ and $p_{z}$ orbital 
	- $s_3$ can have ~18
- Electron shells have [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]] that electrons follow
- the most outer shell that contains an electron is known as a [[Valence Shells]]
- The higher the shell [[Electrons]] exists in, the higher the energy level 
- Each shell is a fixed interval of increase of energy moving away from nucleus
- Electrons returning to a lower shell give off energy as light
