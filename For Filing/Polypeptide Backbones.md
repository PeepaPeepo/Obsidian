[[Polypeptide Backbones]] backbones consists of an [[Amino Group]] and [[Carboxyl Groups]] connected to one [[Alpha Carbons|alpha carbon]] with a H and a R group connected to it. [[Dehydration Synthesis]] form when the $\ce{ - OH }$ of the [[Carboxyl Groups]] is adjacent to the $\ce{ - NH_{2} }$ group creating $C-N$ [[Peptide Bonds]]. 

The backbones have an Amino end called the [[N-Terminus]] and a carboxyl end called the [[C-Terminus]].
