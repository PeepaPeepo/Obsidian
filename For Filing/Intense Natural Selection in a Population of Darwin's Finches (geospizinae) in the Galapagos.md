# Abstract

Survival of Darwin's finches through drought was nonrandom
Large bird with large beaks can crack large and hard seeds that pre dominated in the drought
[[Selection Intensity]] was calculated by [[O'Donald's Method]]

[[Avian]] populations have a few studies on changing environment phenotpyically
Birds are physiologically flexible
Birds have low reproductive rates and long generation times
Focus on darwin finches and direction of natural selection 

[[Geospiza Fortis]] in 40-ha islet of [[Daphne Major]], [[Galapagos]] 1975-1978
1500 birds were color banded and measured
records of banded birds 
Banded nestlings
Three tiems a year data collected
Number of seeds of plant species in 50 random 1m^2
Standardized veisual census of finches over ileantd
minimum 100 point records of feeding behavior of feeeding 

Regular rainfall in daphne major
until a a shortage of rain and geospiza fortis did not breed
declined in 85 percent
Finch eat seeds when bugs arent available

1/388 neslings survived
sex ratio was roughly equal during 1976
now 6 males to 1
surviving birds are larger
