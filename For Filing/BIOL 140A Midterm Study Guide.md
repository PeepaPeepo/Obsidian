 **Study guide for Molecular and Cellular Biology Midterm I:** This is **not** a comprehensive guide. But it does give you an excellent idea of many of the main topics that you should know. Everything we went over in class is fair game, especially topics or information not in the textbook, but discussed in class. Read the questions carefully and ask yourself "did I really answer the question asked?" and "Can I be more detailed or more specific." Though you need to memorize facts and vocabulary, you will not be tested on your memorization capabilities, but on your ability to utilize that information to answer problems and scenarios based on that information or concepts. Good luck!!!!
