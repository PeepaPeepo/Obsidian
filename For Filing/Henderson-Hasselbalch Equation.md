$$\ce{ pH = pK_{a} + \log \frac{[A-]}{[HA]} }$$
$\ce{ pK_{a} = -\log K_{a} }$

The ICE can be used to solve for pH of a buffer solution under all conditions

Use equation when x is small is applicable

x is small is true if 

Initial ocncnetrations of acid and salt are not very dilute
Ka is farily small

For most porblems this means that the intial acid and salt concentrations should be over 100 - 1000 times larger

$\ce{ HA }$ = Weak Acid
$A-$ = Conjugate Base
$\ce{ pK_{a} = -\log(K_{a})}$
