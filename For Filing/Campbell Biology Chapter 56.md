# Concept ???

## Habitat Loss

Major threat to aquatic biodiversity
70% coral reefs have been damaged
Reefs are home to 1/3 of marine fish
40-50% of remaining reefs can be lost in next 30 to 40 years
Trawling can damage sea floo

## Introduced Species 

[[Introduced Species]] are those that humans move from native locations to new regions
Free from native predators, herbivores, pathogens, introduced species may spread fast
Prey on native species or outcompete them

## Over Harvesting

Exploitation of organisms at rates faster they can rebound
Islands are vulnerable
Large organisms have low reproductive rates
Ivory trade of elephants
Elephants can be come extinct
Most elephant populations are protected
Overfishing decimates commercially important wild fish populations
Bluefin tuna declined by 80%

## Global Change

[[Acid Precipitation]] is rain, snow, or fog that contains Sulfuric or Nitric Acids that causes pH below 5.2
Release of sulfur and nitrogen from burning wood and fossil fuels
Kills lake dwelling organisms 
can erode buildings
Aquatic ecosystems will take decades to recover
SO_2

# Concept 56.4: Earth is changing rapidly as a result of human actions

## Nutrient Enrichment

Removal of nutrients from one part to transfer to another
Agricultural crops are exported into crop biomass
Phytoplankton death leads to oxygen depleted by their decomposers resulting in death of aquatic animals

Creates [[Dead Zones]]

## Toxins in the Environment

Human release synthetic material
Persists for long periods
Accumulation within animal fat

## Industrial Compounds and Pesticides

PCBs, pesticides, DDT are subject to [[Biological Magnification]]

## Pharmaceuticals

[[Estrogen]] can shift sex ratio towards females in some species of fish and reptiles
Pharmaceutical drugs enter freshwater ecosystems through human sewage and agricultural runoff

## Plastic Waste

4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons enter the oceans
[[Microplastics]], particles less than 5mm are formed from breakdown of larger pieces from wave action and UV light
Food mistakes it as food and kills them
Contaminates coral reefs have higher rates of diseases
Bacterial pathogens are transported
Plastic blocks light and oxygen penetration
Reduces diseases resistance in corals
25% of fish contain microplastic in guts
Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems 

## Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change

[[Climate Change]] global climate change
Human activities driving it
CO_2 is concern do to global temperature
CO_2 and other green gases reflect infrared radiation back to earth
[[Greenhouse Effect]]

## Rising Atmospheric $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ Levels

Steadily increased over 170 years 
Increased more than 50%
Burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are major factors driving increase
Extreme weather events are becoming more common

## Biological Effects of Climate change

Declines populations
[[Northern Coniferous Forests]] and [[Tundra]] show the strongest effects of global warming
Melting snow and ice
Plants produce leaves earlier in spring
Early blooms might have less active insects to pollinate
2/3 of australia's great barrier reef is severly degraded following heat waves in 2016

# Modeling Climate Change

3 C rise in temperature by end of 21st Century
Human activities also have major impact on the absorption of solar radiation

## Finding Solutions

Slow down by Energy reduction
Renewable Sources of Energy
[[Paris Agreement]] is an international agreement to CO2 emissions

## Depletion of Atmospheric Ozone

$\ce{ O_{3} }$ protects living things from damaging effects of UV Radiation
Springtime ozone layer declines
CFC's destryo atm o3
Cl atoms react with O3 to form O2
Creates holes in the layer
[[Montreal Protocol]] agreement to regulate use of Ozone depleting chemicals

# Concept 56.2 Population Conservation focuses on population size, genetic diversity


Focus on extinction risk in small populations
Focus on Critical Habitats

## Can extinct species be resurrected?

Producing embryo's of extinct species

## Extinction Vortex

Inbreeding and genetic drift can draw a small population down an extinction vortex
Genetic variation

## Minimum Viable Population Size

Least amount to sustain numbers

## Effective

$\ce{ N_{e} = \frac{4N_{f}N_{m}}{N_{f}} }$ ...

## Critical Habitats

## Weighing Conflicting Demands

[[Ecological Role]] dependence

# Concept 56.3: Landscape and regional conservative

[[Charismatic Species]]
