[[Gas Evolution Reactions]] primarily have [[Gases]] included in their reactions. Some [[Gas Evolution Reactions]] can form when one [[Cations]] of one [[Reactants]] reacts with [[Anions]] with another reactant.

In other cases [[Gas Evolution Reactions]] can form [[Intermediate Products]] which are unstable and decompose into simpler products. Some intermediate products can be determined if they the product has enough to make a water molecule to condense.

Aqueous hydrochloric acid is mixed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate in the following equation.

$$\ce{ HCl + NaHCO_{3} -> NaCl + H_{2}CO_{3} -> NaCl + H_{2}O + CO_{2}}$$

Anions and Cations form a double displacement. The resulting $\ce{ H_{2}CO_{3} }$ is unstable, but can be determined that Water can condense from it. If I had to guess, it's due to the [[Electronegativity]] of the O that rips the H away to form water.

# Types of Compounds That Undergo Gas Evolution Reactions

![[Table 7.4 Types of Compounds That Undergo Gas Evolution Reactions.png]]

The following reactants undergo gas evolution reactions: [[Sulfides]], [[Carbonates]], and [[Bicarbonate Ions]], [[Sulfites]] and [[Bisulfites]], and [[Ammonium]]

They all contain some sort of CONS.

# Acid and Metal Reactions

[[Acids]] and [[Metals]] produce [[Gas Evolution Reactions]], where its products are [[Ionic Compounds|Salts]] and water.

$$\ce{ 2HCl + 2K -> 2KCl + H_{2} }$$
