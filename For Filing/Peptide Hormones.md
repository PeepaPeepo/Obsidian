Only made of proteins, [[Peptide Hormones]] are [[Hydrophilic]] substances that are not able to [[Diffusion|diffuse]] through [[Plasma Membranes]]. They bind on [[Cell Surface Receptors]] and send signals into the intracellular space.

This interaction initiates one of three effects, receptors act as an [[Ion Channels]], receptor opens or closes other channels that act as [[Ion Channels]], or activate secondary messengers that cause a cascade of effects.


# Corrections

Peptide hormones freely travel through blood because of their polar and hydrophilic characteristics.

They do not alter the shape of a cell membrane.
