# Introduction

The experiment demonstrates the initiation of Bacterial Transformation with the use of the plasmid, pGLO. Plasmids, DNA molecules, carry genetic information that can give instructions to other cells; in this case giving instructions to nonpathogenic E. coli bacteria. The sample bacteria die when introduced to ampicillin antibiotics, with the introduction of pGLO the bacteria can receive instructions to produce proteins than counteract ampicillin's effects. Various bacterial solutions will placed in four different mini agar plates to compare and contrast E. coli bacteria with and without pGLO.

# Materials and Methods

## Part 1: Bacterial Transformation via the pGLO Plasmid

09/19/2023

Acquired two 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, and labelled each tube as "+DNA" and "-DNA" with "PC" and "09/19/2023". Using a p1000 micropipette, added 250 µL of transformation solution, $\ce{ CaCl_{2} }$, to both tubes, and then added the tubes into a 250 mL beaker of ice for two minutes. Added one colony of E. coli bacteria to each "+DNA" and "-DNA" tubes via circular end of sterile loop, mixed thoroughly and added back onto ice.

Using p200 micropipette, added 20 µL of pGLO plasmid into "+DNA" tube only. Proceeded to ice both "+DNA" and "-DNA" tubes for 10 minutes. Acquired four mini agar plates and labelled them with the following ID's: "LB/-DNA/PC/09/19/2023", "LB/AMP/-DNA/PC/09/19/2023", "LB/AMP/+DNA/PC/09/19/2023", and "LB/AMP/Ara/+DNA/PC/09/19/2023".

Transported tube samples in beaker of ice closer to heat block; promptly transferred tubes to heat block at $42^oC$ and heated for 50 seconds; then placed back onto ice for 2 minutes. Using a p1000 micropipette, added 250 µL of Luria Bertani Broth into each sample to provide nutrition and revitalize the bacterial cell. Incubated both samples at room temperature for 10 minutes in a styrofoam block.

Transferred 100 µL of -DNA into "LB/-DNA/PC/09/19/2023" and "LB/AMP/-DNA/PC/09/19/2023" using a p1000 micropipette. Transferred 100 µL of +DNA to "LB/AMP/+DNA/PC/09/19/2023" and "LB/AMP/Ara/+DNA/PC/09/19/2023" using a p1000 micropipette. Using four new sterile loops for each mini agar plate, performed the streak plate method to distribute bacteria; making sure to keep each lid minimally open to prevent cross contamination.

Sealed each individual agar plate with about three wraps of parafilm, stacked plates with gel side up, secured stack with two wraps of lab tape. Labelled tape with "PC 09/19/2023 Bacterial Transformation". Placed samples in incubator at $37^oC$ until next laboratory session, 09/21/2023.

## Part II Data Collection and Analysis

09/21/2023

After incubating for about 48 hours, laid out mini agar plates in drawer on top of black construction paper, and lit the subjects using a black light with HCT4T5BLB(1) bulb. Took photos of each plate with Pixel 7a smart phone on automatic setting.

**Figure 1:** Raw photo of mini agar plate labelled "LB/-DNA/PC/09/19/2023", showing signs of E. Coli Bacterial colony development after 48 hours of incubation. Development looks like a streaky puddle.

**Figure 2:** Raw photo of mini agar plate labelled "LB/AMP/-DNA/PC/09/19/2023" showing no signs of E. Coli Bacterial colony development after 48 hours of incubation. Proves that E. Coli sample is sensitive to Ampicillin present in agar plate.

**Figure 3:**  Raw photo of mini agar plate labelled "LB/AMP/+DNA/PC/09/19/2023" showing signs of E. Coli Bacterial colony development after 48 hours of incubation. Formation of colonies have distinguishable semi-bioluminescent blots, surrounded by a translucent puddle. Confirms that pGLO transformation most likely gave E Coli Bla, causing resistance to ampicillin to promote growth.

**Figure 4:**  Raw photo of mini agar plate labelled "LB/AMp/Ara/+DNA/PC/09/19/2023" showing signs of E. Coli Bacterial colony development after 48 hours. Formation of colonies have distinguishable UV sensitive blots displaying a prominent neon green glow which is evidence that GFP is successfully functioning in the transformed bacteria. A translucent puddle isn't noticeable as compared to the sample found in Figure 3.

# Discussion

The four different results represented by each mini agar plate demonstrates the E. Coli Bacteria sample's successful transformation with the use of the plasmid, pGLO. In Figure 1 the bacteria's growth is thriving, but Figure 2 proves that the bacteria is sensitive to ampicillin that is integrated in agar plate and cannot grow in that environment. Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows that the bacteria transformed successfully with the introduction of the pGLO plasmid, a DNA molecule that contains three genes with unique protein creation instructions. 

Visual growth in Figure 3 and 4 show that the bacteria is no longer sensitive to ampicillin, which is evidence that Beta-Lactamase is present in those plates. In Figure 4 there is evidence of GFP that makes the bacteria bioluminescent under ultra violet light, but it was only successful in because of AraC in the plate.

By following the lab manual as precisely as possible, the results of the experiments were favorable. To further improve results infection control would be should be practiced as thoroughly as possible, working in a completely sterile environment. The results in this experiment was successful, possibly due to the keeping lids of the agar plate as minimally open as possible during streak method and the use of sterile gloves and instruments.

# Conclusion

Non pathogenic E. coli bacteria can be transformed with the introduction of the plasmid pGLO. By introducing pGLO to the E. coli and transformation reagent solution then briefly heat shocking it, the genes from pGLO can incorporate into the bacterial cells. The experiment had four controls, Figure 1 and Figure 2, was a baseline to show that e. coli bacteria die within Ampicillin environments. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show if pGLO was successfully incorporated represented by the growth of bacterial colonies with resistance to ampicillin. Based on other students experiments, the most notable variables where incubation times, and how mini agar plates were handled. Most 'errors' can avoided by maintaining sterility of environment in mini agar plates to prevent foreign bacteria from interrupting the growth of the controlled e. coli bacteria.
