# Reversibility of Process

[[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] processes are irreversible because of net release of energy
[[Reversible Reactions]] are at [[Equilibrium]] and no change in [[Gibbs Free Energy Change|Free Energy]]

# Spontaneous Processes

Occur because it releases energy from [[Systems]]
Most proceed from a system of higher potential energy to a [[Systems]] at lower potential energy, [[Exothermic Reactions]]
Some are spontaneous but [[Endothermic Reactions|Endothermic]]

# Factors affecting whether a reaction is spontaneous

[[Enthalpy]] change and [[Entropy]] change
[[Enthalpy Changes]] are differences between sum of internal energy and PV work energy of the reactants and products
[[Entropy Changes]] are differences between randomness of reactants and products

# Enthalpy Change $\ce{ \Delta H }$

Measured in kJ/mol
