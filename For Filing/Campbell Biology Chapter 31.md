# How do structure and function in fungi relate to their role in ecoystems?

Closer related to animals

Many ar emulticelluar
Made of [[Hyphae]] into surroundings
[[Spores]] enable fungi to colonize new environments
Secretes secrete enzymes taht break down organic matter
Almost any organic molecule can be digested by atleast some fungi, decomposers in ecosystem
Hyphae absorb the released nutrients

## How do structure and function in fungi to 

Some are single celld ([[Yeast]]) most are complex mulicellular like mushrooms

# Concept 31.1 Heterotrophes that feed by absorptions

[[Hetereotrophs]]
[[Decomposers]]
[[Parasitism]] absorb nutrients from living host
[[Mutualism]]

## Body structure

Single cells are yeast
Multiceulluar mushrooms
Fungal bodies from networks of tiny filaments called [[Hyphae]]

strengthened with [[Chitin]], a structural polymer
Chiutni rich wall prevents cells from lysing due to osmotic pressure 

[[Hyphae]] are the repdroductive strucutre
[[Mycelium]]

Devided by cross walls or [[Septa]]
[[Coenocytic Fungi]] lack septa, have hundreds or thousands of nuclei in continous cytoplasmic 

Fungal Hyphae form an interwoven mass called [[Mycelium]]
Mycelium maximizes surface to volume ration
Grow parimarily in lenght, not girht, using cytoplasmic

Specialized hypahe in mycorrhizal fungle
Largest organism is a fungus 
other have specialized hypahe called [[Haustoria]]

Mutualistic fungi have specialized branching hyphae used to exchange nutrients with their plant hosts

arbusecules are specialized hypahte that penetrate platn cell walsl but not the cell membrane

[[Mycorrhizae]] fungus roots
Deliver phosphate ions and minerals to plants
Two major types of mycorrhizae fungi

[[Ectomycorrhizal Fungi]] form sheaths of 
[[Arbscular Mycorrhizal Fungi]]

# Concept 31.2 Fungi produce spore through sexual or asexual life cycle

Fungi propgate themselves by producing vast numbers o spores, either sexually or asexually
Spores are careiied long distancs by wind or water

## Sexual Reproduction

Fungal nuclei and spores are usually haploid
Sexual reproduction requires the 
[[Karyogamy]]
Haploid neuclie fuse
Zygote
Haploid Spores

# Asexual reproductionn

[[Molds]] produce haploid spores asexually by mitosis and form visible furry mycelia
[[Yeast]] repdouce asexually and cocus with pinching of small bud cells of a parent cell

[[Deuteromycetes]] 

# Concept 31.1: The ancestor of fungi was aquatif single celled flagellated protist

[[Opisthokonts]] includes fungi, animals, and protistan relatives

## The origin of fungi

Fungi are most cloesly related to serval groups of single celled protists
NUclearrids are closely related amoebas that feed on algae and bacteria
Animals are most cloesly related to different group of protists called 

## THe move to land

Fungi were among hte ealiest colonizer of land 
Fossil evidence
Molecular ana

# Concept 31.4 Fungi have readiated into a diverse set of lineages

[[Metagenomic]] studies have led to the discovery of 

## Cryptomycetes

[[Cryptomycetes]] and [[Microsporidians]] 

# Concept 31.4: Fungi have radiated into a diverse set of linages

[[Metagenomic]] show new groups

[[Cryptophytes]] and [[Microsporidians]] form sister group and are basal fungal lineage

- [x] Learn major characteristics between fungi ✅ 2024-08-20

## Cryptomycetes

Only 30 species knonw
Found in soils and marine and freshwater habitats

Aerobic and anaerobic spcies
Have flagelleated gro

## Microsporidians

1300 known species are unicellular parasites of protists and animals
Can synthesize a chitin rich cell wall
Highly reduced mitochonria and small genomes with as few as 2000 genes
Spores that infect hosts

## Chytrids

[[Chytrids]] 1000 known species
Found in lakes, soil, and marine habitats include hydrothermal vents
All have flagellated spores called [[Zoospores]]

## Zoopagomycetes

900 Known of [[Zoopagomycetes]]
Parasitic or commensal symbionts of animals
Form filamentous hyphae and reproduce aesexualy nonflagellated spores
Reproduce sexually form a durable [[Zygosporangium]] which protect the zygote
Nonflagellated wind dispered

## Mucoromyetes

[[Mucoromycetes]] 
MOlds in this group include important decomposers
Black bread mold
Many live as parasites or pathogens or mutualists with plants
Forms [[Zygosporangium]]
[[Sporangia]] develops at the tip of upright hyphate, spores
Arbuscular forming clade of fungi called [[Glomeromycetes]]

## Ascomycetes

90,000 known species of [[Ascomycetes]]
Marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats
Unicellular yeasts to elaborate [[Cup Fungi]] and [[Morels]]
Called Sac Fungi named after [[Asci]]
Ascomycete species form [[Lichen]] association with green algae
Form [[Mycorrhizae]] with plants, other live within plant leaves and produce toxic compounds to insects
Reproduce aesxaully by enourmous numbers of aesxual spores called [[Conidia]]
[[Ascocarp]] contain Eight [[Ascospores]]
conidia fuse wit hteh hyphae of a mycelium from a different mating type
[[Dikaryrotic]] cells are formed, each containing two haploid nuclei
*Neurospora crassa* a bread mold
Genome was published in 2003
3/4 as many genes as fruit fly *Drosophila*

## Basidiomycetes

50,000 known species of [[Basidiomycetes]] including mushroom, puffballs, and shelf fungi
Named after [[Basdium]] a cell in Karyogamy and meiosis occur
Club like shape of basidium give rise to common mame club fungus
Decomposers of wood
Life cycle includes [[Dikaryotic Mycelium]]
We eat [[Basdiocarp]]
[[Basidiospores]]
Some form fair circles

## Concept 31.5 Fungi play key roles in nuetrient cycling

Are [[Decomposers]]

## Fungi as Mutualists

mutual relationship with plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and animals

## Funcugs plant mutualism

All plant species harbor symbiotic [[Endophytes]], fungi that live inside leaves or other parts of plants without causing harm
Most are [[Ascomycetes]]
Some make toxins to defend insects, heavy metals

## Funcus Animal Mutualisms

Digestive services
Break down plant material i nguts of cattle and other grazing mammals
Ants bring leaves to fungi and they eat fungal hyphae

## Lichens

Symbiotic associations
Grow on rocks, rotting logs, trees, and roofs in various forms
Fix nitrogen and provide organic N
Important pioneers on new rock and soil surfaces
Penetrate surface and break it down checmially
Lichens are most likely the firsts inhabitants in new areas
ALso parasitic, 10 - 50% are lost to fung, grain crops also suffer major annual losses

## Fungi as parasites

Animals are less suceptible
Fungal infection in animals is [[Mycosis]]
Such as [[Ringworm]]
Treated with Fungicidal lotions and powders
[[Coccidioidomycosis]] fatal systemic produces tuberculosis like symptoms in the lungs

**never breathe spores**

Ihabitatn of moist epithelia such as vaginal lining

## Practical Uses of Fungi

Fungi that make cheeses, alcoholic bev, and bread
Medical value such as penicillium
Fungi is leading to medical applications in biotechnology
