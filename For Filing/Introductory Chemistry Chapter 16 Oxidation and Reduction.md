[[Combustion Reactions]] is a type of [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions]]
[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] is the loss of [[Electrons]]

$$\ce{ Fe^0 -> Fe^3+ + 3e' }$$

3+ is the [[Oxidation Numbers|oxidation number]]
Fe is a [[Reducing Agents]]
Fe loses electrons

[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Reduction]] is the gain of [[Electrons]]

$$\ce{ F + e' -> F- }$$

Charges of ions are labelled with [[Oxidation Numbers]]
F is [[Oxidation Agents]], it gains electrons and gives electrons 

## Five Rules for assigning Oxidation States

Rules 1 - 5 If any two rules conflic, follow the rule that is higher

Oxidation state of an atom in a free element is 0
THe oxidation state of a [[Monoatomic Ions]] is equal to its charge

$\ce{ H_{2} -> 2H+ + 2e' }$
$\ce{ O_{2} + 2e' -> O_{2} }$

3. Sum of oxidation states of all atoms in
	1. nuetral molecule or fomrula unit is 0
	2. polyatomic ion is equalt to the charge of the ion
4. In their compounds
	1. group I metals have an oxidation state of 1+
	2. Group II have oxidation states 

## Oxidation States: Electronic Bookkeeping

[[Oxidation Numbers]] 

$\ce{ C^4+O^2+_{2} -> C + O_{2} }$

$\ce{ Li+H- }$ cases where hydrogen is not positive

$\ce{ NCl_{3} }$

Check electronegativity, less electronegative atoms become positive

$\ce{ Ca + 2H_{2}O -> Ca(OH)2 + H_{2} }$

[[Polyatomic Ions]] net charge, and the entire molecule isn't the participating constituent.

$\ce{ N_{2}O_{3} }$
+3 -2

Just criss cross it

Balancing [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]] with mass and charge

$\ce{ Al + AgCl -> AlCl_{3} + Ag }$
Al 0 charge
Ag +1
Cl -
Al 3+
Cl 3-
Ag 0

Separate into to half reactions

$\ce{ Al -> Al^3+ + 3e' }$
$\ce{ Ag+ + e' -> Ag }$

Multiple Ag reaction by 3 to balance with Al reaction

## A Procedure for Balancing Redox Reactions in Acidic Solution Using the Half-Reaction Method

1. Assign oxidation states
2. Separate the overall reaction into two half-reactions
3. Balance each half-reactions with respect to mass
	1. Balance all elements other than H and O
	2. Balance O by adding H2O
	3. Balance H by adding H+
4. Balancing each half reaction with respect to charge by adding electrons
5. Make the number of electrons in both half reactions equal
6. Add the two half reactions together
7. Verify that the reaction is balanced

$$\ce{ MnO_{4}- + Cl - -> M^2+ + Cl_{2} }$$

Mn +7
O 2-

$\ce{ 2Cl- -> Cl_{2} +2e- }$


Adding 4 H2O to balance one of the half eq that contains 4 oxygens
Balance H with H+ ions

Basic reactions, H+ is neutralized with OH- 


# 16.1 The End of the Internal Combustion Engine?

[[Fuel Cells]]
[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]] are implied tot have both [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] and [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Reduction]]
[[Hydrogen-Oxygen Fuel Cells]]
Reactions involving the transfer of electrons are [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]]
[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] is the gaining of Oxygen

# 16.2 Oxidation and Reduction: Some Definitions

***[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]] in [[Molecules|Molecular]] reactions, [[Metals]] [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidize]] and [[Nonmetals]] [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Reduce]]***
Metals usually oxidize because the loss of electrons
Nonmetals gain electrons from the metal that oxidized, and now are reduced
OIL RIG
Fundamental definition of oxidation is OIL and RIG respectively
Substances that are oxidized are [[Reducing Agents]], implies that Metals are Reducing Agents
Reduced agents are [[Oxidizing Agents]]

# 16.3 Oxidation States: Electron Bookkeeping

[[Oxidation Numbers|Oxidation States]] for each element based on number of electrons assigned to it
Substances do not need to be ionic to have assigned states 

## Rules for Assigning Oxidation States

1. Free atoms states are 0
2. Oxidation state of monoatomic ions is equal to tis charge
3. Sum of oxidation states of all atoms are neutral or equal to its charge of the ion
4. In compounds, group 1 and 2 have their typical charges
5. Hierarchy the previous rules from top to bottom

# 16.4 Balancing Redox Equations

# 16.5 The Activity Series: Predicting Spontaneous Redox Reactions

Observing if a substance has a greater tendency to lose electrons than another
$\ce{ Mg }$ has greater tendency to lose electrons than $\ce{ Cu }$

Reaction within $\ce{ Mg(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Mg^2+(aq) + Cu (s) }$ is [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]]
Mg atoms have greater tendency than Cu to lose electrons
Cu versus Mg^2+, Cu would not oxidize because the tendencies

## The Activity Series of Metals

[[Activity Series of Metals]] lists metals in order of decreasing tendency of losing electrons
Top tier have greater tendencies, easily oxidized
Low tier is the least reactive
Reactions in the activity series is an oxidation half reaction
Top tier reactions are likely to occur forward and vice versa

***Any half reactions on the list is [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] if its a forward and reverse paired reactions***

Neutral metal will only react with a metal with a half reaction on lower tier of the [[Activity Series of Metals]]

## Predicting Whether a Metal will Dissolve in Acid

![[Table 16.1 Activity Series of Metals.png]]

[[Acids]] dissolve [[Metals]] 
Copper, Gold, and Silver have [[Spontaneity|Nonspontaneous]] dissolution with [[Acids]] 
Zinc oxidizes in the presence of H+
H+ dissolution rules have the same rules as metal rules Metals above H on the activity list can be dissolved 
Exception is that HNO3 can dissolve metals in a lower tier

# 16.6 Batteries: Using Chemistry to Generate Electricity

[[Electrical Current]] is the flow of electric charge, such that electrons flow through a wire or ions
[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]] involve transfers of electrons
Separating redox reactants such that the reducers and oxidizers have their own cell and bridge them with a wire or something to complete their circuit
Process is [[Electrochemical Cells]]; devices that create electrical current from a spontaneous redox reaction, or that uses electrical current to drive a nonspontaneous redox reaction
Cells that create elecetrical current from spontaneous reactions are [[Voltaic Cells]] or [[Galvanic Cells]]
Batteries are [[Voltaic Cells]] that are typically designed for portability

Solid strip of Zn placed into a solution $\ce{ Zn(NO_{3})2 }$ can form  [[Half-Cells]]
Solid strip of Cu is placed in $\ce{ Cu(NO_{3})2 }$ to form another half cell
strips are connected to a light bulb
Natural tendency for Zn to Oxidze and Cu2+ to reduce results in a flow

In [[Voltaic Cells]], the metal strip where oxidation occurs are the [[Anodes]] like [[Anions]]
Metal strip in the where the reduction occurs is the [[Cathodes]]

Electrons flow from anode and produce positive ions in the half cell
If it was one flow the it would stop
Circuit must be completed with [[Salt Bridges]] and is typically made of a strong electrolyte
It allows for more ions to flow

in [[Voltaic Cells]], electrical voltage is teh driving force to cause electrons to flow
High V corresponds to a high driving force
Driving force that causes electrons to flow through a wire is a potential difference or [[Voltage]]

Voltage of voltaic cell depends on tendencies of the reactants to undergo oxdation and reduction
[[Voltaic Cells]] dye because annode dissolves away

## Dry-Cell Batteries

Flashlight batteries are [[Dry Cells]] because it doesnt contain liquid water, or large amounts of it
It has as zinc casing that is the anode and the 
Cathod is a carbon rod within a paste of $\ce{ MnO2 }$ that also contains $\ce{ NH_{4}Cl }$
The two half reactions produce a voltage of 1.5 v
Two ore more connected in series creates a greater voltage
[[Alkaline Batteries]] use a base

## Lead Acid Storage Batteries

Car batteries are [[Lead-Acid Storage Batteries]] and consits of six electrochemical cells wired in series
Each cell produces 2 volts to sum into 12 v
Each cell has a pourous lead anode

# 16.7 Electrolysis: Using Electricity to do chemistry

[[Voltaic Cells]] have [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] redox reactions produce electrical current
[[Electrolysis]], utilizes electrical current to drive [[Spontaneity|Nonspontaneous]] redox reactions
[[Electrolytic Cells]] are used for electrolysis
Applications include breaking down $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ into constituent elements, Convering oxide metals to pure metals, and plating metals onto other metals

# 16.8 Corrosion: Undesirable Redox Reactions

[[Corrosion]] is the [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] of [[Metals]]
Common one is rusting of iron
Iron and water reacts to oxidize
Counteraction includes [[Sacrificial Anodes]] in contact wiht iron, typically a metal above iron in the series

# Voltaic versus electrolytic Cells

[[Voltaic Cells]] have [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] reactions
[[Electrolytic Cells]] have [[Spontaneity|Nonspontaneous]] reactions
	Supply energy from outside the [[Systems]]
	E_cell is negative
	DeltaG will be negative and 
	Electrons are drawn off the anode


# Electrochemical Cells Overview

# Electrolytic Cells

Electrical energy is supplied by a dirrect current power supply
AC is alternating
Some electrolysis reactiosn require mroe voltage thana e cell predicts called Overvoltage
Electrolyte can be either an aqueous salt solution or a molten ionic salt
Cations in the electrolyte are attracted to the cathod and anion are attracted to annode
Cation pick up electrson from teh cathod are reduced, anions release electrons to the anode and are oxidized



# Electrolysis 

![[Electrolysis]]


# Fuel Cells

They are batteries in which reactants are constantly being added

# Electrolysis of Aqueous Solutions

Possible Cathode Reactions
	Reduction of cation to metal
	Reduction of water to H2

Possible anode reactions
	Oxidation of anion to element
	Oxidation of H2O to O2

Oxidation of electrode
	Particularly cu
	Graphite doesnt oxidize

Half reactions that lead to least negative ecell will occur unless overvoltage changes the conditions

# Electrolysis of Pure Compounds

Compound must be in molten state
Electrodes are normally graphite
Cations are reduced at the cathode to metal element
Anions are oxidized at the nonmetal element 

# Practive problem: Predicting the products of electrolysis reactions

# Electroplating

Work pieces are cathodes

Cations are reduced at cathode and plate to surface of the work piece
Annode is made of the plate mental and the anode oxidizees and replaces teh metal cations in the solution

# Stoichiometry of Electrolysis

Amount of product is relative to the number of electrons transferred
The number of mols of electrons that flow through the cell depends on current and time
1 amp
1 mole e- = 96.485 coulombs of charge

# Practice. Problem: Stoichio of Electrolysis

$\ce{ Au^3+ (aq) + 3e- -> Au(s) }$

5.5 A for 25 minutes

$\ce{ 1 A = \frac{1C}{s} }$

Min to seconds to match up with Amp definition
Coulombs/Second 
1 moles of electrons/Coulombs
1 mols AU/3 Moles 
Molar mass

# Corrosion: Nondesirable Redox Reactions

![[Corrosion]] 

# Reduction of O2

Easy to reduce in moist conditions
Easier under acidic ocnditions
Most metal ions lie below 02 on the table of standard reduction potentials

# Rusting

Anodic readions have Fe(s) oxidized to Fe2+
Electrons travel through teh metal a cathodic region where o2 is reduced
Electrolytes promote rusting, because tehy enhance current flow
Acids promote rusting by lowering pH which will lower Ered of O2
