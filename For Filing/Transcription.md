[[Transcription]] are the [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of any kind of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] with instructions from [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Templates|DNA Templates]]
A strand of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] is formed onto the [[Template Strands]] and creates [[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]]

[[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerase]] separates [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] strands and attaches to a region of DNA called [[Promoters]], and futher down is a part that is actually transcribed called the [[Transcription Unit]]

attaches complementary [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] strand
It assembles $\ce{ 5' -> 3' }$ direction and doesn't need a primer.

Three Major stages are [[Initiation]], [[Elongation]], and [[Transcription Termination]]

# Synthesis of RNA Transcripts

## Initiation

[[Transcription Factors]] recognize the [[TATA Box]] of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and mount
[[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II|RNA Polymerase II]] uses the initiating [[Transcription Factors]] as a guide to mount
Another [[Transcription Factors|Transcription Factor]] fully seats [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II|RNA Polymerase II]] and forms an [[Transcription Initiation Complex]]
The [[Transcription Initiation Complex]] unwinds the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and forms [[Transcription Bubbles]] and begins [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesizing]] [[Nucleotide Triphosphate|NTPs]], about 25 ntps from the start point, to form [[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]]

## Elongation

[[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II|RNA Pol II]] transcribes at about 40 [[Nucleotides]] per second
Additional [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerase]] can work on a single [[Genes]] to increase [[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]] production

## Termination

[[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II|RNA Pol II]] keeps going until the [[Polyadenylation Signal Sequence]] is transcribed; it signals a cut about 10 - 35 [[Nucleotide Triphosphate|NTPs]] later.
