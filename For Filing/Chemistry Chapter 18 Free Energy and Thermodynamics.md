[[Gibbs Free Energy Change]]

# Thermodynamics versus Kinetics

How much reactants or products are produced based on amount of energy of/in the [[Systems]]

# Thermodynamics and Spontaneity

Processes that will occur are called [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]]
[[Spontaneity]] is determined by comparing the [[Chemical Potential Energy]] of the system before the reaction with the free energy of the system after the reaction

# Reversibility of Process

any [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] process is irreversible becauase net release of energy when it proceeds in that direction

Reverible reactions at equilibirium results in no change in free energy
one side is spontaneous and the opposite is not 

# Spontaneous Processes

Occurs because they release energy from the system
Most spontaneous processes proceed from a system of higher potential energy to a system at lower potential energy ([[Exothermic Reactions]])

Some proceed from a system of lower potential energy to a system at higher potential energy ([[Endothermic Reactions|Endothermic]])

# Factors affecting whether a reaciton is spontaneous

Two facts are [[Enthalpy]] and [[Entropy]]
[[Enthalpy]] 
[[Entropy]] and its change 

# Enthalpy change

Measrued in kJ/mol
exothermic if bonds in the products are stronger than the bonds in the reactants
stronber bonds = more stable moleucles
exothermic = energy released
Enthalpy change is favorable for exothermic reactions and unfavorable for endo

[[Entropy]] 

# Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

Total energy of the universe cannot change, but energy can be transferred from one place to another

[[Laws of Thermodynamics]] 
[[Boltzmann Constant]] 

# Entropy: Expansion of Gas in a Vacuum

Energetically equivalent points

# Macro states and Probability 

# Changes in Entropy $\ce{ \Delta S }$

Entrop change is favorable whe nthe result is a more random system
Changes that increase the netropy are as follows
reactions with products in higher random state
Reactions that have a larger number of products
Reaecionts that ave larger numbers of product molecules than reactant molecules
increase in temperature
solids dissociating into ions upon dissolving


[[Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation]] 

# Heat Transfer and Changes in Entropy of the Surroundings

Processes like [[Condensation]] are [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] even though water vapor is more random
There must be a large increase in entryop of hte surroundings
Entropy must come from heat released by the system

# Heat Exchange and Delta_Surr

Endothermic it tkaes heat from surroudnings, decreases entropy of surroundings
Entropy of surrounding changes depeeds on the original temeprature

# Quantifying Entropy Changes in SUrroundings

Entropy change in surroundings is proportional to the amount gaineed or lost

$\ce{ q_{surr} = -q_{sys} }$

Entropy change in surroundings is inversly propotional to temperature

$\ce{ \Delta S_{surr} = -\frac{q_{sys}}{temperature (T) } }$

$\ce{ -\Delta H }$ / system heat

# Temperature Dependence of $\ce{ \Delta S }$

Low temp is spont
High temp is nonspont

# Gibbs Free Energy

$\ce{ \Delta G }$ will be negative under the following conditions
It is the maximum amount of work energy that can be released to the surroundings by a system for a constant temperature and pressure system

Called Chemical potential 

[[Gibbs Free Energy Change]] 

# Standard Conditions

[[Standard States]] are states of a material at a defined set of conditions
[[Gases]] at 1 atm of pressure
[[Solids]] or [[Liquids]] at 1 atm and 25 C
[[Solutions]] at 1 M
