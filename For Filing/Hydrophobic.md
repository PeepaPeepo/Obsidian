[[Hydrophobic]] characteristics are determined by the relation of [[Electronegativity]] between [[Atoms]] of [[Molecules]]. When [[Nonpolar]] [[Covalent Bonds]] are formed, there are no partial charges that [[Water]] molecules can be attracted to. 

Water can only form [[Hydration Shells]] around hydrophobic substances.
