# Introduction

Traditional Medicine/Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM) dependance
Employed in developing countries 
Antimutagenic agents have been classified as desmutagens and bio-antimutagens
[[Desmutagens]] promomtes elimation of genotoxic agents from organisms that inactivate the mutagens partially or totally by enzymatic or chemical interaction before attacking DNA
[[Bio-Antimutagens]] can suppress of process of mutation after DNA is damanged, as well acting in the repair and replication processes of the damaged DNA

# Garlic 

## Overview

TACM over 4000 years
First pieces of evidence include 22 forumulatiosn in Eyyptian papyrus of Ebers Codex, remdies for cardiac problems, cephalea, and snake bites
Greece treats intestinal and pulmonary disorcers
Second world war used as antiseptic for woudns and ulcers of soldiers
Attributed antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antifungal, antithrombotic, analgesic, coagulant, antiashmatic, antipyretic, antihypertensive, anticoagulant etc

Made of water, fiber, lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins C and A, 

Solubility as Lipid-Soluable Allyl Sulfer [[Diallyl Sulfur]]DAS, [[Diallyl disulfide]]DADS, and [[Diallyl trisulfide]] DATS
[[g-glutamyl S-allylcysteine]] SAC and [[S-allyllmercaptocysteine]] SAMC

## Antigenotoxic Studies of Garlic

[[Chromosomal Abberations]] test of crude extract of garlic against damaged produced by [[Mitomycin C]] and [[Cyclophosphamide]] in mouse bone marrow cells
Induced low level of chromosomal damage
Comination with extract resulted in significan reduction of chromosomal abberations

Capacity of crude extract of garlic to domish frequence of ChAb by sodium arsentite for a period of 30 and 60 days
**Genoprotection was significant**

New test combing [[Cyclophosphamide]] and Crude Garlic
Percentage intake of garlic extract before administering [[Clastogen]]
Cytogenic damage with two high doses were reduced

Levels Heterocyclic aromatic amines 
Marinating shows reduced total number of [[Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines]] and their mutagenic activity, diminution could ber modified on terms of cooking time

Process of biotransformation of fres, ground or powder garlic can be affected by very high cooking temps

Aged garlic contains higher amount of SAC than fresh garlic

Studies of antigenotoxic capactiy of Allium sativum has been conducted emplying the micronucleus assay

Garlic is an ideal canditdate for good anticlastogenic agent
Garlic extracts ar enot cytotoxic or genotoxic

[[Sister Chromatid Exchange]] (SCE) 
Getnotoxic agents that act during phase s of hte cellular cycle are good inducers of SCE and chromosomal abberations

powders reduced between 35 and 60 percent of genetic damanged produced by bot hmutagens in liver and colon of hte niaml

garlic in the form of powders, extracts, homogenates, and oil notable reduces frequence of single or double strand reaks of dna produced by Hydrogen Peroxide, NDMA, IQ, MNU, and mycotoxins suc has AFB, and Zeraraleonone

# Perspectives and Conclusions

Investigations shows usefulness of assays, Ames TEst Sister Chromoatid Exchange, chromosomal abberations, micronucleus, and comet assay to confirm antigenotoxic effects of garlic against different muta gentic or cainogenic agents in vivo and in vitro

Mechanisms of antigenotix actions of garlic
Related to Antioxidant Actvity
might be more mechansims inflovled

Proposed exploring effect on metabolizer enyzme of drugs
Inhibition of tumer growth 
Induction of apotosis
Effective stimulation of immune system

Majority of studies on its genoprotective potential condlude and suggest this property can be from Phytocomponents present in its chemical composition

Anylsis of phytochemicals

not fully definitive of protector spectrum
There are contradictory data on aspect

Organosulfur compounds have been considered beneficial to health
Phytocompounds may lead t otoxcity and adverse effects

Needs more studying
