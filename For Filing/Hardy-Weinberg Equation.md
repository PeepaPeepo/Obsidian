$$\ce{ p^2 + 2pq + q^{2} = 1 }$$
p = Dominant allele
q = Recessive allele

p^2 = Homozygous Dominant Genotype
q^2 = Homozygous recessive genotype

2pq = Heterozygous Genotype

# Conditions

- Not evolving at particular locus
- No mutation
- random mating
- no natural selection
- no genetic drift do to large population
- no gene flow
-
