# Concept 17.1 Genes specify proteins via transcription and translation

[[Traits]] are determined by [[Genes]] that contain information by a specific sequences of [[Nucleotides]] along stretches of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] dictates the [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of [[Proteins]] and [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] [[Molecules]] involved

[[Gene Expression]] is the process where [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] directs synthesis of proteins and RNA.

Expression of genes lead to [[Transcription]] and [[Translation]]

## Evidence from Studying metabolic defects

[[Archibald Garrod]] suggested [[Genes]] dictate [[Phenotypes]] through enzmes, proteins, that catalyze specific chemical reactions in cells

[[One Gene One Enzyme Hypothesis]] 

## Nutritional Mutants in Neurospora

[[Neurospora]] is a [[Haploid]] simple ratio of gentoype to pheotype
xan grow on [[Minimal Medium]] 

## The Products of Gene Expression: A Developing Story

Not all [[Proteins]] are [[Enzymes]]

[[Proteins]] are constructed from two or more [[Polypeptides]]

[[One Gene One Polypeptide Hypothesis]]

[[Alternative Ribonucleic Acid Splicing]]

## Basic Principles of Transcription and Translation

[[Genes]] provide instruction, but doesn't build it directly 
[[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] is chemically similar to DNA but it contains ribose and swaps [[Thymine]] with [[Uracil]]
[[Transcription]] is the [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] using information from [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]
Information is transcribed or rewritten from [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] to [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] [[Parent Strands]] can be [[Template Strands]] for [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]

The complementary strand of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] is protein-building instructions.
The RNA created is called [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]

[[Transcription]] is the term for the [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of any kind of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] on a [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] template

[[Translation]] os the synthesis of [[Polypeptides]] from the information from [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]

Sites of translation are [[Ribosomes]] 

[[Bacteria]] do not have [[Cell Nucleus|Cell Nuclei]], membranes do not separate [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] from ribosomes. 

It allows [[Translation]] of an [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] while [[Transcription]] is happening

[[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] [[Cells]] have nuclei and separate transcrption and translation.

[[Transcription]] occurs in the [[Cell Nucleus]] and [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] goes into the [[Cytoplasm]] for [[Translation]]
[[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] is modified for leaving the [[Cell Nucleus]]

[[Transcription]] of a protien coding gene is [[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]]

Initial [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] transcripts from any gene are called [[Primary Transcripts]]

## The Genetic Code

[[Biologists]] realized there are 4 [[Nucleobases]] that make 20 [[Amino Acids]]

## Codons: Triplets of Nucleotides

Triplets of [[Nucleotides]] [[Bases]] are the smallest units of uniform lengths that code for all amino acids.

[[Nucleotide Triplets]] are [[Genes|Genetic]] instructions for [[Polypeptides]] are written in [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] as [[Codons]] then its transcribed in to a complementary [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]
[[Genes]] determine sequence of [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]], only one of the [[Template Strands]] get transcribed.
[[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] is compeltementary to [[Template Strands]] of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]

[[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] triplets are [[Codons]] and written in $\ce{ 5' -> 3' }$ direction

[[Codons]] can be used for [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] nucleotide triples along [[Nontemplate Strands]], the codons are complementary to template strand and identical to [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]. [[Nontemplate Strands]] are known as [[Coding Strands]].
Sequence of codons are decoded in to amino acids during translations.

## Cracking the Code

[[Stop Codons]] or termination codons mark ends of translation [[Methionine]] acts as a start codon as AUG [[Start Codon]] 

All polypetide chains begin with methionine

[[Reading Frames]] 

# Evolution of the Genetic Code

Genetic code is nearly universal shared by organisms from the simplest bacteria to the most complex plants and animals 

# Concept 17.2 Transcription is the DNA directed synthesis of RNA: A closer look

## Molecular Components of Transcription

[[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] is transcribed from template strand of a gene. [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases]] pries two strands of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and attaches complementary [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]

[[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] can assemble only in $\ce{ 5' -> 3' }$ direction, and don't need a primer like [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]] do. 

Specific nucleotides along the DNA mark the beginning and end of transcription

The [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] sequence where the [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] attach to are called [[Promoters]], and the end of a sequence in bacteria are called [[Terminators]] 
The stretch of DNA downstream from the promoter is called the [[Transcription Unit]]

Eukaryotes hae atleast three time of [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] such as [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II]] which is involved with [[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]]

## Synthesis of an RNA Transcript

Three stages of transcription are [[Transcription Initiation]], [[Transcription Elongation]], and [[Transcription Termination]] of the [[Ribonucleic Acid Chains]] 

## RNA Polymerase Binding and Initiation of Transcription

The promoter sequence of a gene includes within it the [[Transcription Start Points]], [[Nucleotides]] where [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] begins [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] 

![[Figure 17.8 The Stages of transcription initiation, elongation, and termination.png]]

[[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] creates pairs upstream from start point. 
[[Promoters]] includes a [[TATA Box]] 
[[Transcription Factors]] can recognizes specific sequences
[[Transcription Initiation Complex]] 
Certain sections of [[Promoters]] are important for binding [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] to register correct start points.
[[Eukarya|Eukaryotes]] have a set of [[Proteins]] called [[Transcription Factors]] which help guide the bind of [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] and [[Initiation]]  

## Elongations of the RNA Strand

Transcription progresses at a rate of about 40 [[Nucleotides]] per second in [[Eukarya|Eukaryotes]]
A single gene can be transcribed simultaneously by several molecules of [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] 
The congregation of many polymerase molecules simultaneously transcribing a single gene increases the amount of [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] transcribed from it, which produce protein in larger amounts

## Termination of Transcription 

[[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II|RNA Polymerase II]] transcribes a DNA sequence called [[Polyadenylation Signal Sequence]], it will signal a cut 10 - 35 nucleotides later.

# Concept 17.3 Eukaryotic Cells Modify RNA After Transcription

[[Enzymes]] in the nucleus modify [[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]] into [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] and is called [[RNA Processing]]. Both ends of the [[Primary Transcripts]] are altered.

## Alteration of mRNA Ends

3' ends receives a [[5' Caps]], a modified form of [[Guanine]] G, aded on the the 5' end after transcription of the first 20-40 nucleotides.

At the 3' end, an enyzme addes 50 -250 more [[Adenine]] to form a [[Poly-A Tails]] 

[[5' Caps]] and [[Poly-A Tails]] facilitate the export of mature [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] from the [[Cell Nucleus]], and it protects it from [[Hydrolysis|Hydrolytic]] [[Enzymes]].

It helps [[Ribosomes]] attach to the [[5' Ends]] of [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]
[[Untranslated Regions]] can be found at 5' and 3' ends of the [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] are are referred to as [[5' Untranslated Region]] and [[3' Untranslated Region]] 
The do not translate into [[Proteins]] but serve other functions such as [[Ribosomes]] binding

## Split Genes and RNA Splicing

[[Ribonucleic Acid Splicing]] is whne large poritions of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] [[Primary Transcripts]] are removed, and the difference is reconnected

![[Figure 17.12 RNA Processing RNA Splicing.png]]


It's like editing a FCPX timeline, cut out the introns

Length of transcription along human DNA is about 27,000 nucleotide pairs

The noncoding segments of nucleic acids that lie between [[Coding Regions]] are called [[Intervening Sequences]] and the other regions are called [[Expressed Sequences]], which are translated into [[Amino Acids]] sequences.

Exceptions include the [[Untranslated Regions|UTRs]] of exons at the ends of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]

[[Expressed Sequences|Exons]] of RNA exit the nucleus

[[Intervening Sequences|Introns]] and [[Expressed Sequences|Exons]] are used for [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] and [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] sequences.

Removal introns are done by a large complex called [[Splicesomes]]
It binds to short nucleotide sequences along an [[Intervening Sequences|Introns]] and joins exons together that surrounded the intron.

The small RNAs in the spliceosome not only particpate in the spliceosome assembly and site recognition, but also catlyze the splciing reactions

## Ribozymes

[[Ribozymes]] are [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] molecules that function as [[Enzymes]]
[[Ribonucleic Acid Splicing|RNA Splicing]] can occur without proteins or without RNA molecules
[[Intervening Sequences|Intron]] RNA functions as [[Ribozymes]] and [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] its own removal
[[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]] removes its own [[Intervening Sequences|Introns]]

Three properties of RNA enable to functions as enzymes

Regions of RNA can base pair in itself and gives it a strcutur.
Some bases in RNA contain functional groups that can participate in [[Catalysis]]
RNA can [[Hydrogen Bonds]] with other acids
Base paring between RNA of spliceosome and RNA of a primary RNA transcript locates teh region where teh ribozyme cataylzes splicing

## The Functional and Evolutionary Importance of Introns

Many genes are known to give rise to two or more different poly peptides, depending on which segments are treated as exons during RNA processing [[Alternative Ribonucleic Acid Splicing]] 

Because of alternative splicing, humans can produce more types of proteins.

Proteins had modular architecture consisting of discrete structural and functional regions called [[Domains]], one domain of an enzyme can include active site, and others might allow to bind to a cell membrane.
Presence of introns in a gene can cause evolution called [[Exon Shuffling]]
[[Intervening Sequences|Introns]] increase probability of crossing over between [[Expressed Sequences|Exons]]

# Concept 17.4 Translation is the RNA Directed synthesis of a polypeptide A closer Look

## Molecular Components of Translation

The message are the codons from [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]

[[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|Transfer RNA]] are the translators, it transfers [[Amino Acids]] from the [[Cytoplasm]] pool of amino acids to the growing [[Polypeptides]] in [[Ribosomes]]

[[Cells]] keep a stock of all [[Amino Acids]] by [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesizing]] from other compounds or taking them from a surrounding solution

[[Ribosomes]] is made of [[Proteins]] and [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] and adds the added amino acid to a growing end of a polypeptide chain

## Structure and Function of Transfer RNA

[[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] has a specific amino acid at one end of the structure and it has a nucleotide triplet that can base pair with the complementary codon on [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]

[[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] is a single rna strand that is about 80 [[Nucleotides]] long, complementary bases can hydro bond to itself.

It can form cloverleaf shapes and roughly into an L shape
the 5' and 3' ends are close to one end of the structure

the protuding 3' end is a mounting site for an amino acid
opposite end of the l shaped molecule is the [[Anticodon Loops]], which is a particular nucleotide triplet that base pairs to a specific [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] [[Codons]]

[[Anticodon Loops|Anticodons]] are written in 3' -> 5'  to align with complementary sequences

[[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] codon that codes for amino acid glycine
[[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] can base pair with it the [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] with its anti codon, and carries glycine on the other end.

[[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] moves through ribosome, glycine wil lbe added to polypeptide when it reads the codon

[[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] reads nucleic acid word from [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] and interpret it as protein word, the [[Amino Acids]]

[[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] is transcribed from [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Templates|DNA Templates]], and is made in the nucleus and travels to cytoplasm. It is used repeatedly and picks up from amino acids in the cytosol, transfer to ribosome and go back to pick up thte same type of amino acid

[[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] binds to an [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] codon that specified amino acid adn no other to the ribsome

The correct matching is checked by [[Aminoacyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Synthetases|Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases]]
The active site of [[Aminoacyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Synthetases|Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases]] fits a specific combination of amino acid and tRNA.
The exact combination of amino acid docking site and anticodon end.
There are 20 different synthetases for each of the acids.
Syntehtase joins a given amino acid to the trna and catalyze covalent attachment  powered by [[Hydrolysis]] of atp. 
It forms [[Aminoacyl Transfer Ribonucleic Acid]] or [[Aminoacyl Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|Aminoacyl tRNA]] or charged trna 

Second instance of molecular recognition is [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] [[Anticodon Loops|Anticodons]] and the appropriate [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] [[Codons]]

Rules of base pairing between the third nucleotide base of a codon and complemenetary tnra anticodon are relaxed compaired to the first two

The flexible base pairing at the codon postion is called [[Wobble Rules]] 
Explains why codonds for a given amino acid most offen differst at the third base

## The Structure and function of Ribosomes

[[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] [[Ribosomes]] are larger than bacterial ones
[[Ribosomes]] facilitate specific coupling of [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] [[Anticodon Loops|Anticodons]] with [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] [[Codons]] during [[Proteins]] [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]]
It consists of a Large Subunit and Small Unit whcih are made up of [[Proteins]] and one or mroe [[Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acids]] or [[Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acids|rRNA]]
Subunits are made in the nucleolus
[[Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acids|rRNA]] genes are transcribed, and rna is processed with proteins from the cytoplasm

[[Ribosomal Subunits]]  are exported through [[Nuclear Pores]] into the [[Cytoplasm]]
Large and Small to form a function ribosome only when attached to an [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] molecule

1/3 of the mass of a ribosome is protein and the rest is four [[Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acids|rRNA]]
[[Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acids|rRNA]] is the most abundant type of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]

[[Ribosomes]] have binding sites for [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] and three binding stites for [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]]. [[Peptidyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Binding Site]] or [[Peptidyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Binding Site|P Site]] holds [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] carrying the growing [[Polypeptides]]

[[Aminoacyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Binding Site]] or [[Aminoacyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Binding Site|A Site]] holdes the [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] carrying the next [[Amino Acids]] that binds to the chain polypeptide

Discharged [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] leaves from the [[Exit Sites]] 

[[Ribosomes]] hold the [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] and [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] close and positions the new [[Amino Acids]] to it can be added to the [[C-Terminus|Carboxyl End]] of the [[Polypeptides]], [[Carboxyl Groups]] 

[[Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acids|rRNA]] is the main constituent of the a and p sites and acts as [[Catalysts]] of peptide bond formation [[Polypeptides]]

## Building A Polypeptide

[[Translation]] can be divided into three stages: [[Translation Initiation]], [[Translation Elongation]], and [[Translation Termination]], and all of them require Protein Factors.
Some steps of [[Initiation]] and [[Elongation]] use energy from [[Hydrolysis]] of [[Guanosine Triphosphate]] 

## Ribosome Association and Initiation of Translation

[[Initiation]] brings [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]], a [[Aminoacyl Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|Charged tRNA]] with first [[Amino Acids]] of the [[Polypeptides]] and the [[Ribosomal Subunits]]. 
[[Ribosomal Subunits|Small Subunits]] binds to both [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] and a specific [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] which carries [[Methionine|Met]]. 
[[Ribosomal Subunits|Small Subunits]] with [[Initiator Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|Initiator tRNA]] binds to 5' cap or [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] and scans downstream along [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] until the [[Start Codon]] 
[[Initiator Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|Initiator tRNA]] [[Hydrogen Bonds]] to it. AUG signals the start of translation and the [[Reading Frames]] of [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]
[[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]], [[Initiator Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|Initiator tRNA]], [[Ribosomal Subunits|Small Subunits]] and [[Ribosomal Subunits|Large Subunits]] forms the [[Translation Initiation Complex]]
[[Proteins]] called [[Initiation Factors]] bring it all together. [[Guanosine Triphosphate|GTP]] [[Hydrolysis]] energy is used to form the complex
[[Initiator Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|Initiator tRNA]] is loaded into the [[Peptidyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Binding Site|Peptidyl-tRNA Binding Site]]. [[Polypeptides]] are synthesized from [[N-Terminus]] towards the [[C-Terminus]] 

## Elongation of the Polypeptide Chain

[[Elongation Factors]] ([[Proteins]])
Energy usage in first and third step of elongation
[[Codons]] recognition requires [[Hydrolysis]] of one [[Guanosine Triphosphate|GTP]] which increase accuracy, another gtp is used for Translocation 

[[Ribosomes]] and [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] move relative to each other
Empty [[Transfer Ribonucleic Acids|tRNA]] is releaseed from [[Exit Sites]] or [[Exit Sites|E Site]]

## Termination of Translation

[[Elongation]] continues until [[Stop Codons]] in [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] reaches [[Aminoacyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Binding Site|Aminoacyl-tRNA Binding Site]]
Stop codes do not code for amino acids, [[Release Factors]] that is shaped similarly to [[Aminoacyl Transfer Ribonucleic Acid|Aminoacyl tRNA]] binds to stop codon in A site, and gives a water molecule from [[Cytosol]] and [[Hydrolysis|Hydrolyze]] the [[Polypeptides]] from the [[Peptidyl-Transfer Ribonucleic Acid Binding Site|Peptidyl-tRNA Binding Site]]

## Completing and Targeting the Functional Protein

[[Translation]] is not enough to make functional protein

## Protein Folding and Post Translational Modifications

[[Polypeptides|Polypeptide Chains]] form specific shapes from [[Primary Structures]], [[Secondary Structures]] etc. 

[[Genes]] determine [[Primary Structures]]

[[Post-Translational Modifications]] may be required to complete protein to function.

Some amino acids can be modified by adding other [[Macromolecules]] or [[Phosphate Groups]]

[[Enzymes]] can remove one or more [[Amino Acids]] from the leading or end of the chain

## Targeting Polypeptides to Specific Locations

[[Free Ribosomes]] and [[Bound Ribosomes]]

[[Free Ribosomes]] are suspended in [[Cytosol]] and synthesize protines

[[Bound Ribosomes]] are on the cytosolic side of the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]] or the [[Nuclear Envelopes]]

[[Bound Ribosomes]] make [[Proteins]] of the [[Endomembrane System]] as well secreted ones like [[Insulin]]

[[Ribosomes]] can switch between free and bound

[[Polypeptides]] [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] beings as a free ribosome translating [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] unless the growing polypeptide cues the ribosome to attach to the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]]

proteins for endomembrane system or secretion is marked by [[Signal Peptides]] which target it to the ER

It is about 20 amino acids at or near the [[N-Terminus]] pf the [[Polypeptides|Polypeptide Chains]] and recognized as it comes from ribosome by protein rna complex called [[Signal-Recognition Particles]] 

It escorts the ribosome to a receptor protein built into the er membrane

The receptor is part of a multi protein translocation complex 

It grows polypeptide snakes into the er lumen through [[Protein Pores]]

The signal is removed by an enzyme

The rest of the polypeptide releaseed into a solution in the ER lumen if need to be secreted

If needs to be a membrane, Amino acids sequences further in the chain cause to be stuck in the ER membrane

It travels via [[Transport Vesicles]] to the destination

There are different types of peptides signalling 

## Making Multiple Polypeptides in Bacteria and Eukaryotes

Multiple robsomes translate [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] at the same time

A single [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] is used to make copies of polypeptides at the same time

[[Polyribosomes]] can be seen through EM, it can be free or bound
multiple [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] can be used to make more things

# Concept 17.5 Mutations of one or a few nucleotides can affect protein structure and Function

[[Mutations]] are sources of new [[Genes]]
[[Point Mutations]] are small scale and affect only a one or a few nucleotide pairs

If it adverse effect on pheotype than it is a [[Genetic Disorder]] or [[Hereditary Disease]]

Examples include [[Sickle-Cell Disease]] or [[Familial Cardiomyopathy]]

## Types of Small Scale Mutations

many mutations occur outside of protein coding genes

[[Nucleotide-Pair Substitutions]] and [[Nucleotide-Pair Insertion Deletions]] 

[[Nucleotide-Pair Substitutions]] replaces one nucleotide and its partner with another pair of nucleotides.

[[Silent Mutations]] have no observable effect on phenotype, it can be a change in codon but results in the original amino acid

[[Missense Mutations]] is a mutation of codon outputing a amino acid of similar quality or characteristics OR changes a amino acid that doesn't directly play in protein function

[[Nonsense Mutations]] changes a codon into a stop codon and terminates translations prematurely and mostly leads to nonfunctional proteins

## Insertions and Deletions

[[Nucleotide-Pair Insertion Deletions|Nucleotide-Pair Insertions]] and [[Nucleotide-Pair Insertion Deletions|Nucleotide-Pair Deletions]] is bad cause it alterates [[Reading Frames]] and causes [[Frameshift Mutations]] 
Primary caused by nonadditions or subtractions of multiples of three

It can work out only if its closed to the end of the gene.

Intersionts and deltions occur oustide of coding regions

## New Mutations and Mutagens

[[Mutations]] can occur from errors during [[DNA Replication]] or [[Recombinations]] that lead to Nucleotide Piar substitutes, inters, or deletes.

Incorrect nucleotide during replication and not proofread and edited make a bad template and cause [[Spontaneous Mutations]]

Physical and Chemical agents that interact with DNA and mutate are called [[Mutagens]]

X-rays and other high energy radation are hazardous

[[Nucleotide Analogs]] are similar to normal dna nucleotides but pair incorrectly during DNA rep
[[Carcinogens]] are cancer chemicals

## Using CRISPR to Edit Genes and Correct Disease-Causing Mutations

[[Gene Editing]] such as [[Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9 System]] is the direct maniuplation of genes for practical purposes

[[Cas9]] is a bacterial protein defends bacteria against viruses anad acts with Guide RNA made from CRISPR region of the bacterial genome

[[Cas9]] is a [[Nuclease]] that custs double stranded DNA moelcules

ITs directed by Guide RNA Molecule

# What is a Gene? 

Gene is a dna sequence that codes for specific polypeptides chains or a functional RNA Molecule

Most genes code have non coding segments like introns

[[Promoters]]

A [[Genes|Gene]] is a region of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] that can be [[Gene Expression|Expressed]] to produce a final functional product that is either a polypeptide or [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] Molecule.
