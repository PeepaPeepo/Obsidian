# Chapter 1 Epidemiology Past and Present

## 1.1 Epidemiology and its uses

### What is epidemiology?

**[[Epidemiology]]** is the study of distribution and determinants of diseases and injuries in populations 

### What is public health?

Primary goal of **[[Public Health]]** is to reduce injury, disability, disease, and premature death in the population.
**Epidemiology** is a core discipline within public health.
**Preventing** diseases, and promoting healthy behaviors.
Focuses on **populations, preventions, interventions**, and partly moderated by government
Core components include **assessment, assurance, and policy development.**
The Public health system is comprised of **public, private, and voluntary entities** that work as a network.
It is an organized effort to **prevent morbidity and mortality**.

### Basic Terms

**[[Morbidity]]** is related to diseases or disabilities
**[[Mortality]]** is related to death
**Incidence** is rate or risk of developing a condition
**Prevalence** is proportion of population with a condition
### What is health?

World Health Organization defined it as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.

### Determinants of health

Some of them include genetics, behavioral, social, environmental, and personal health care.
One of the greater contributors is behavioral patterns. 

### Upstream vs Downstream

Saving people down the river versus preventing people from even getting to the river. Eliminate or prevent the problem in the first place.
### Additional Useful terms

**Epidemic** is an increased occurrences of diseases that exceeds 'normal' rates.
**Pandemic** is an epidemic that affects several countries or continents.
**Endemic** diseases is something that is consistently present in the environment, it also describes 'normal' rate of diseases.
**Diseases** is a medically applied term that indicates physiological or psychological dysfunction.
**Illness** is the experience of a patient.
**Sickness** the state of dysfunction of the social role of an ill person.

### Uses of Epidemiology

Epidemiology is characterized by close connection between scientific study of causes of diseases and use of the knowledge for treatment and prevention; heavier focus on prevention. There are seven uses of epidemiology:

**Table 1.2**
*General Uses of Epidemiology*

1. **Historical Study** of health of population, and rise and fall of diseases in the population.
2. **Community Diagnosis** 
3. **Workings of health services**
4. **Individual's chances and risks of diseases**
5. **Complete the clinical picture**
6. **Identifying syndromes**
7. **Search for causes of health and diseases**

## 1.2 Evolving patterns of morbidity and mortality

### Twentieth century changes in demographics and disease patterns

[[Epidemiology]]
**Epidemiologic transition** focuses on dramatic changes in morbidity and mortality that occurs in relation to demographic, biologic, and socioeconomic factors during the 20th century. This is indicating the transition from infections to noninfectious diseases that came a long with changes with technological improvements.

Changes in mortality and fertility lead to a shift in age distribution of populations, which is known as the **Demographic Transition**

**Population Pyramids** represent the distribution of populations and their respective age groups.

# Chapter 2 Causal Concepts

## 2.1 Natural History of Disease

### Stages of Diseases

**Natural History of Disease** is a timeline of progression of stages. 
There are for main stages that professor wants exact names of: **Stage of Susceptibility**, **Stage of Subclinical Disease**, **Stage of Clinical Disease**, and **stage of recovery disability or death**
The defining transition between stages are the following: **Exposure**, and **Onset of Symptoms**
Two more main events are **Pathological Changes** that lead to the onset of symptoms, and **Time of Diagnosis** which occurs at stages of clinical diseases.

The range of history is from [[Stage of Susceptibility]] to [[Stage of Recovery Disability or Death]]
The [[Stage of Subclinical Disease]] can either be an [[Incubation Period]] or [[Induction Period]] depending on if the agent is infectious or non infectious. 
[[Stage of Clinical Disease]] starts with Onset of Symptoms until resolution.

The previously mentioned steps are all stages of natural history of disease.

**Figure 2.1**
*Stages in the Natural History of Disease and Levels of Prevention*

![[Pasted image 20250224092158.png]]

**Induction Periods** apply for noninfectious diseases, for example it can take 2 - 12 years to develop leukemia after exposure from nuclear radiation.

**Stage of Subclinical Disease** can be be subdivided into **Induction Period** and **Latent period**. There is a threshold of induction where enough causal action where disease is unavoidable, this happens until clinical symptoms occur. 

[[Induction Period]] ranges from exposure to pathologic changes or disease ination.

**Figure 2.4**
*Induction Period, Latent Period, and Empirical Induction Period*

![[Pasted image 20250224092119.png]]
Major events for this section includes **causal action, disease initiation, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and clinical outcome**.

### Stages of Prevention 

**Primary Prevention** focuses on stage of susceptibility, and its main goal is to prevent disease from happening.
**Secondary Prevention** occurs in Stage of Subclinical Disease after individual is exposed to causal factor, and the goal is to prevent or delay the disease from occurring. It also looks to reduce severity of disease.
**Tertiary Prevention** occurs during stage of clinical disease, and it prevent or minimize progression of disease. This example is like if some had diabetes, and they treated it to prevent symptoms of blindness.

## 2.2 Variability in the Expression of Disease

### Spectrum of Disease

**Spectrum of Diseases** refer to the idea that diseases can have a range of effects and intensities.

In the context of infectious disease, **gradient of infection** is used to describe severity of a disease. Example HVI infections can be mild to severe.

### Epidemiologic Iceberg

**Epidemiological Iceberg** is the concept that apparent diseases or outcomes is only a small part of larger problem. 

## 2.3 Causal Models

**Cause** is something that produces an effect or brings about a result, outcomes are based on this 'input'

### Component Cause Model (causal pies)

Most diseases are caused by multiple components, **causal interaction** is the sum of multiple components that bring out an effect or outcome.
This can either be applied to infectious or noninfectious diseases.
**[[Rothman's (1976) Causal Pies]]** show the contribution of components in disease [[Etiology]]. 
[[Sufficient Causal Mechanisms]] is a combination of causal factors that guaranteed an outcome, or disease occurrence.
[[Necessary Causal Factors]] are factors that are present in every [[Sufficient Causal Mechanisms]].
[[Contributing Component Causes]] are essential cause they complete the pie when added to [[Necessary Causal Factors]].
Any component that completes a pie is a [[Causal Complements]].
A Common causal complement is [[Susceptibility]] 
Factors that are working together [[Interact Causally]]
[[Causal Interactions]] have direct health relevance?
[[Rothman's (1976) Causal Pies|Causal Pies]] only really show [[Individual Risk]] as a binary outcome, get the disease or not type of situation.
[[Average Risks]] is an estimation based proportion or ratio of members that develop particular condition
[[Prevalence of Causal Complements]] it sounds like all existing causal complements within the population.
### Causal Web

[[Causal Web]] demonstrates the interconnectedness of direct and indirect causes of disease.
[[Direct Causes]] are 'proximal to the pathogenic mechanism' This is saying that this cause is the source of the disease, an actual heart attack is from arterial blockage and death of heart muscle. Indirect causes are those that cause the blockage in the first place.
[[Indirect Causes]] are upstream from the disease causing mechanism.
The levels of the web can be at a Macro, Individual, or micro level.

### Agent, host, and Environment

[[Agents]] are factors that cause the disease, [[Host]] are the targets of agents, and Environments can also affect the host.
[[Host Factors]] are variables that influence the outcome of the diseases, these can be genetic dispositions, or behaviors, and other susceptibility factors. Its boundaries are expanded to physiological, anatomical, genetic, behavioral, occupational, or constitutional.
[[Environmental Factors]] are external conditions other than the agent that contribute to disease process.

## 2.4 Causal Interference

[[Causal Inference]] is the process that checks if an association is causal or not. Its really a check to see cause and effect based on evidence.
Proof is impossible, but causal statements can be made stronger.

### Report of the Advisory Committee to the U.S. Surgeon General, 1964

Data should be supported with clinical, pathological, and experimental data.
It considers many perspectives or variables.
Many or multiple studies should be considered.
Statistical methods aren't enough. At this point field reports are strong methods to look for more evidence.

### Hill's Framework for Causal Inference

[[Hill's Framework for Causal Inference]] checks if associations from epidemiologic is causal. It contained nine major elements. Really this is a checklist of what strengthens a inference, a conclusion based on evidence.

[[Inference]] 

1. **Strength**, larger relative risk leads to stronger evidence for causality
2. Consistency, demonstrate associations through different methods leads to stronger evidence for causal interaction
3. Specificity, This looks at the relationship between the causal factor and specific outcomes. If one factor lead to many factors, then its less specific.
4. Temporality, focuses on exposure to causal factor and its relation to onset of disease.
5. Biological Gradient, focuses on relation to increase exposure and relative intensity on outcome. Does intense amount of smoking always lead to particular outcome?
6. Biological Plausibility, checks if association is plausible with known facts
7. Coherence, Evidence should support each other
8. Experimentation, focuses on experimental data 
9. Analogy. implies similarity between things 

# Chapter 3 Epidemiologic Measures

## 3.1 Measure of Disease Frequency

### Background (67)

**[[Measures of Disease Frequency]]** quantifies how often diseases occur within a population. They are also called **Measures of occurrence**.

==[[Measures of Occurrence]] is interchangeable with [[Measures of Disease Frequency]].==

Diseases frequency is measured in three ways: 
- [[Incidence Proportion]]
- [[Incidence Rate]]
- [[Prevalence]]

**All measures of [[Measures of Disease Frequency]] are [[Ratios]]**
==[[Numerators]] in Measures of Disease Frequencies are is a measure of counts of cases==
Numerators are always just SOME SORt of case
Measures of disease frequency is a ratio between case counts to populations or person times.
==[[Denominators]] is a measure of population size or [[Person-Time Unit]]==

Things to consider when looking at [[Measures of Disease Frequency]]:
1. Is the Denominator a population or person time?
2. If its a population, is it closed or open?

**Closed Populations** are **Cohorts**, its a fixed group of members, and they only disappear after death or no longer a risk of becoming a case. Cohorts in this case always shrink 

A [[Cohorts]] can only be [[Closed Populations]] because they can't gain new members from birth or immigration. [[Cohorts]] only can shrink in numbers due to death or removal of risk of a disease in this case. Example, if the analysis is risk of uterine cancer, you only can count individuals with the capacity of getting ie: they have a uterus.

[[Open Populations]] add members via birth and immigration and lose them via emigration and death. If a population maintains a steady state, then they are **stationary**

[[Open Populations]] are categorized based on the ratio of inflow or outflow of population, are they consistently at particular number? are they dwindling? If they are at an 'equilibrium' then they are considered [[Stationary]].

### Incidence Proportion (Risk)

[[Incidence Proportion]], is also known as [[Incidence Proportion|Risk]].
It is used to describe a disease: "The Risk of a Disease"
The numerator in this case is the number of disease onset or [[Incidence]]
[[Incidence]] is the number of new cases
[[Prevalence]] is the number of all existing cases
The [[Denominators]] consist of number of ==individuals at risk== in a ==closed population== at beginning of ==follow up==

$$Incidence\ Proportion = \frac{no.\ of\ disease\ onsets}{no.\ of\ individuals\ at\ risk\ at\ beginning\ of\ follow-up}$$

[[Incidence Proportion]] = Proportion of incidences to ***individuals at risk***, its not helpful/make sense to include people that doesn't apply to a disease.

**Incidence Proportion** can only be measured in cohorts.
It is considered **average risk** of developing the condition under a period of observation
It can only work when a **length of time at risk must be specified**
**Chacteristics of population** needs to be specified

**Illustrative Example 3.1 Cohort n = 5 (incidence proportion)**

The total number of people is cohort was 5 people
The length of time specified is 10 years shown by the range of the figure.

Considering the formula:

$$Incidence\ Proportion = \frac{no.\ of\ disease\ onsets}{no.\ of\ individuals\ at\ risk\ at\ beginning\ of\ follow-up}$$

Incidence Proportion is described as a **10 year incidence proportion**
And during that 10 year range, **2 people had a disease** onset **out of** the **5 total cohort population**.

**Figure 3.4**
*Schematic for Illustrative Example 3.1*
![[Pasted image 20250313122630.png]]

**Illustrative Example 3.2 Uterine Cancer (incidence Proportion)**

Consider a study that recruits 1000 women for a study of uterine cancer. Investigators found that 100 of the people have already had cancer or a hysterectomy.

The important factor of a denominator of a closed factor is that if the individuals are or are not at risk. **We only want people at risk**

This cohort was **followed for 5 years**. **45 subjects developed the disease**.

The incidence proportion is stated as the following:

The **Five-Year Incidence Proportion** is $\frac{45}{900}$, or 5% (We don't want decimal values) or 5 cases per 100 women. 

5% can be read as 5 cases per 100 women **at risk**

### Summary of Incidence Proportion (Risk)

[[Incidence Proportion]], or [[Incidence Proportion|Risk]], is the proportion of disease onsets to at risk population of a cohort followed for a certain time.

Statements would be formed as a X year risk of a disease is a certain percentage.

Key components of Risk, or Incidence proportion are 
- Closed Population or Cohort
- A specified range of time following a cohort
- Number of people at risk (exclude people who cannot get the disease)
- Number of Onsets

### Incidence Rate (Incidence Density)

[[Incidence Rate]] is a number of disease onsets divided by sum of person time.

$$Incidence\ Rate = \frac{no.\ of\ disease\ onsets}{sum\ of\ person-time\ at\ risk}$$

[[Person-Time Unit]] is amount of time a person is observed during study. 1 person for one year is 1 person year

Look at how many time units the person had until the end or until disease onset.
You can just keep the units of original measurement of time, then look at each member's contirbution.

Incidence Rate of Open populations can be found by dividing number of onsets and average of population size multiplied by duration of observation.

### Prevalence

It is the proportion of of people with condition to people at risk. This can be measured in open and closed populations.
## 3.2 Measures of Association

### Background

**Measures of Association** quantifies effect of an exposure on an outcome.
**Exposure** is used to denote factors that may increase or decrease likelihood of health outcome.
**Disease** is any dependent variable or health outcome.
**Incidence** counts onsets of events only independent of mean duration of disease.
**Prevalence** counts both new and old cases.
Exposure and disease refer to explanatory variable and response variable.

### Absolute versus relative comparisons

Measuring associations is a comparison of rate or risk in an exposed group vs non exposed group.

**Absolute Comparison** are made via subtraction and is not qualitative. 100kg man vs 50 kg man where absolute comparison is 50 kg difference.

**Relative Comparison** is measured via division.

Comparing 1 per 100 person years vs 2 per 100 person years, the difference via subtracting is the **rate difference** explained in absolute comparison.

But if its looked at as a ration, then the rate can be seen as a rate ratio exposure in relative terms.

### Absolute measures of effect

Rate of risk difference is the difference between risk or rate of disease in exposed and non exposed groups. 

$RD=R_{1}-R_{0}$

$R_{1}$ represents ==risk== or ==rate== of disease in the exposed group
$R_{0}$ represents risk or rate of disease in non exposed group

==[[Incidence Proportion]] or [[Incidence Proportion|Risk]] is the number of onset of condition to number of people at risk==
==[[Incidence Rate]] is the number of onsets over person time units==

[[Rate or Risk Difference (RD)]] is a comparison between exposed and non exposed groups

Negative Values are a decrease of rate or risk

#### Illustrative Example 3.10 Improved Physical Fitness and Mortality (rate difference)

A study of physical fitness and overall mortality found that men who ==improved their physical fitness==
from the unfit level to the fit level had an age-adjusted death ==rate of 67.7 per 10 000 person-years==
(Blair et al., 1995). Men who ==remained unfit== had an age-adjusted death ==rate of 122.0 per 10 000 person-years.== Thus, improved physical fitness was associated with an RD=R1− R0 =(67.7 per 10 000 person-years) – (122.0 per 10 000 person-years)= −54.3 per 10 000 person-years. 
This indicates 54.3 fewer deaths per 10 000 person-years associated with improved fitness.

[[Exposure]] is ==any== explanatory ==factor== that ==increases or decreases== the likelihood of a ==specific outcome==.
[[Disease]] is any dependent variable or ==outcome==

**"Disease"** is mortality
**"Exposure"** is Improved physical fitness
$R_{1}$ represents the risk or rate of exposed group
$R_{1}$ = men 'exposed' to exercise and their death rate was 66.7 
### Relative measures of effect

**Rate or Risk Ratio (RR)** is the ratio between risk rates of exposed and non exposed groups.

$RR=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}}$

A ratio measures the risks as **Relative Risks**

**RR** can indicate direction and magnitude of associations.

Example where 61 of 136 IV drug users were HIV positive, vs etc

$$RR=\frac{R_{1}}{R_{0}}$$

$$5.63=\frac{44.45\%}{7.96\%}$$

**Relative risk difference** where 1 is subtracted from RR. 

This statistic expresses the risk difference relative to the baseline risk established by non exposed group.

Take $RR$ and subtract 1 from it. The sign prefix determines if they are increasing to decreasing.

### Odd Ratios

**Odds Ratio (OR)** is another relative measure that focuses on odds.

Odds can be the thought as the ratio of successes:failures. Example is that 1 in 5 people experience an adverse event. Risk is 20% but odds are 1 to 4. 

Odds can only bue used in place of incidence proportions and prevelances but not to person-time time data where failures are not available. 

**Table 3.2**
*Notation for cross-tabulated counts.*

|            | Disease + | Disease - | Total   |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| Exposure + | $A_{1}$   | $B_{1}$   | $N_{1}$ |
| Exposure - | $A_{0}$   | $B_{0}$   | $N_{0}$ |

A = case
B = non-case
$_{1}$ = exposed
$_{2}$ = nonexposed

Odds of disease in exposed group is the ratio between $\frac{A_{1}}{B_{1}}$ 
Odds of non exposed group is just $\frac{A_{0}}{B_{0}}$

Ratio between odds are Odd Ratios
### Relation between RR and RD

# Chapter 4 Descriptive Epidemiology

## 4.1 Introduction

### What is descriptive epidemiology?

[[Descriptive Epidemiology]] is a broad set of epidemiologic activity where the purpose is to describe disease occurrence and hypothesize about the cause. Focus on occurrence of diseases and figure out the causes of them.

Descriptive epidemiology is described by [[Epidemiological Variables]] such as person, place, and time.

Rate of a event is number of events divided by population size. Rates are expressed with whole number numerators so if a mortality rate is 0.00933 from 921:98,765, then rate should be expressed as 933 per 100,000. Multiply both sides by 100,000.

## 4.2 Epidemiologic Variables

[[Person Variables]] describe characteristics and attributes of population and subgroups. 
[[Place Variables]] are characteristics of locations where people live, work, and visit.
[[Time Variables]] address disease occurrence in relation to various time parameters such as time since exposure.

### Person

[[Person Variables]] include characteristics such as age and sex, or race and ethnicity etc. The book says that factors are related to genetic tendencies, living habits, and social exposure. Occupation of individuals can act as a variable.

### Place

[[Place Variables]] are characteristics of a location where people live, work, an visit. It can be described as a geographic boundary such as a street or city or country. Environmental characteristics like rural or urban.

### Time

Occurrences of disease over time can be looked at different snapshots. [[Epidemic Curve]] analyzes proportion of cases over time. Types of patterns include [[Sporadic]], [[Endemic]], [[Point Epidemic]], and [[Propagating Epidemic]].

## 5.1 Introduction to Etiologic Research

Epi Hypotheses

1. Studies should address defined research hypothesis or research question
2. Hypotheses must be based o nsound causal mechanisms in specfic terms that can be tested
3. Hypotheses are refinement as new information becomes available

### Hypothesis Statement

Needs a broad question that you want answer
Selected elements of an epi research question

1. Source Population
2. Eposure variable
3. Disease variable
4. Counfounding variables
5. Dose response
6. Time resoponse sample size

### Variable Yaz Example

[[Confounders]]

Birth control assocations with age, trauma, sugery

### Ethnics: Studying Human Subjects

Institutional review board review if humans who engage are protected.
[[Informed Consent]] is important 
[[The Belmont Report]] is a guideline for human case study 
Casualties are bad
[[Data Safety Monitoring Board]] checks if outcomes are good or bad, or outweighs goal

### Equipoise

[[Equipoise]] is balanced doubt
Cannot expose a participate to harm, like smoking
Cannot withhold known benefit to subjects

### Selected Study Design Elements

[[Referent Group]] Only judge effects of an exposure relative to the baseline determined by referent or control group

### Experimentation

How was exposure assigned?
Experimental study is a assignement or 
Observational study classify

### Unit of Observation

### Longitudinal v X-Sectional

Longitudinal follows 
## 7.1 Introduction

Needs cohort study
Classify as exposed or non-exposed
Retro spective cohort studies

# Chapter 10 Screening for Disease

## 10.1 Introduction

- Symptoms are subjective sensations made by patients
- Signs are perceptions and observations by examiner
- Diagnostic tests are measures of physical, immunologic, and biochemical processes
- Tests can be mundane or technical where technical is clinical chemistry
- Reliability is agreement upon repetition
- Validity is the ability to discriminate people with and without diseases

## 10.2 Reliability (agreement)

[[Reliability]] refers to extent where intra- or inter-rater ratings agree from one to another evaluation. More agreements between two places mean the data is reliable. It can be in the context of [[Inter-rater Reliability]] and [[Intra-rater Reliability]].

[[Inter-rater Reliability]] is agreement between two or more unique raters
[[Intra-rater Reliability]] is agreement within one rater 

This is referred to as agreement or reproducibility, measurements that agree are more reliable than not.


### The Kappa Statistic (225)

Kappa Statistic $(\kappa)$ measures the level of agreement between rates that occur beyond chance.

Kappa when it is equal to +1 means complete agreement.

Calculating kappa for binary outcome, data are laid out in two by two table.

**Table 10.5**
*Notation for measuring agreement for a binary diagnostic test*

|         | Rater B |       |       |
| ------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Rater A | $+$     | $-$   |       |
| $+$     | $a$     | $b$   | $g_1$ |
| $-$     | $c$     | $d$   | $g_2$ |
|         | $f_1$   | $f_2$ | **N** |
*Note: $f_{1},f_{2},g_{1},g_{2}$ are sums of their respective row or column values.*

**Observed Proportion of Agreement ($p_{obs}$)** is 

$$p_{obs}=\frac{a+d}{N}$$
positive/positive + negative/negative result all over population. This equation is looking at the sum of the data they both agree with, +/+ and -/- all related to the total population N.

**Expected proportion ($P_{\exp}$) of agreement due to chance**

$p_{\exp}=\frac{f_{1}g_{1}+f_{2}+g_{2}}{N^{2}}$

column total 1 times row total 1 + column total 2 + row total 2
All over Population squared.

**Kappa Statistic**

$\kappa=\frac{p_{obs}-p_{\exp}}{1-p_{\exp}}$

The denominator is 100% minus expected level of agreement due to chance. 

kappa is the difference between observed and expected proportion divided by 1-pe.

### The Kappa Paradox

$\kappa$ is affected by prevalence of condition being studied, and leads to raters with high agreement but low kappa value.

To counter act the kappa paradox, **Brennan-Prediger kappa coefficient** or **G index** and **Gwet's AC1**

**Proportion of specific positive agreement ($p_{pos}$)** can be a solution to kappa paradox

$p_{pos}=\frac{2a}{f_{1}+g_{1}}$ 

This is twice the positive tests over the total tests of Rater B and A

and **Proportion of Specific Negative Agreement ($p_{neg}$)**

$p_{neg}=\frac{2d}{f_{2}+g_{2}}$

## 10.3 Validity

[[Validity]] describes ability of test or diagnostics to accurately discriminate people who have the disease and not. It includes comparing a test with a gold standard test.

It can be measured in four ways, **sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive, and predictive value negative**.

At this point in the crosstab, the results can be different categories.

**True Positives (TP)** Positive for disease and test
**True Negatives (TN)** Negative for disease and test
**False Positives (FP)** Negative for diseases but true with test
**False Negatives (FN)** Positive to diseases, but false with test

### Sensitivity and Specificity

**Sensitivity (SEN)** is probability of test result being positive when test is done on people who have disease or condition.

[[Sensitivity]] is the proportion of positive tests to population that have the disease. It is checking 

Conditional probability notation reads it as $Pr(T+ | D+)$, where Pr means probability, | is conditional upon.

Sensitivity is calculated by testing subject who have the disease. So in this case its the proportion of people with TP + FN because that is the population with the disease.

**Table 10.7**
*Notation for calculating sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive, and predictive value negative*

|        | Disease + | Disease - | Total   |
| ------ | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| Test + | TP        | FP        | TP + FP |
| Test - | FN        | TN        | FN+TN   |
|        | TP+FN     | FP+TN     | N       |

**Specificity (SPEC)** Is probability of test will be negative when administered to disease/condition free people

This is true negative divided by all those who do not have diseases.

### Predictive value positive and predictive value negative

**[[Predictive Value Positive of a Positive Test (PVPT)]]** is the probability of a person with positive test will have disease. 

$PVPT=\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$

This is a ratio of true positives vs all positives true or false.

Predictive Value of a Negative test (PVNT) is the probability that a person that tests negative is actually negative. 

$PVNT=\frac{TN}{TN+FN}$

**Predictive Value of a Negative Test (PVNT)** is the same as PVPT but in terms of negative tests.

### True Prevalence and apparent prevalence

**True Prevalence (P)** is the relationship with all diseased people versus the population. 

**Apparent Prevalence (P*)** is positive tested people over population who tested.

Prevalence is either actually sick people of the population, or apparent is people who are tested positive over all the population.

## Summary

### Reliability Notation

Variables, a, b, c, and d were just variables that represented agreements in cross tabulation.

### Validity Notation

Validity describes the accuracy of tests that determines if an individual has or does not have a disease. It has four measurements, sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive, and predictive power negative.

Cross tabulation of Validity is as follows


| test/disease | +              | -             | Tot     |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| +            | True Positive  | False Postive | TP+FP   |
| -            | False Negative | True Negative | FN + TN |
| tot          | TP + FN        | FP + TN       | N       |
Sensitivity checks the true positive value against all people who have the disease (TP + FN)

[[Sensitivity]] = TP/TP+FN
[[Specificity]] is the ratio of true negative values vs all that do not have the disease.
SPEC = TN/FP+TN
Predictive Value Positive of Positive Test is the the proportion of True positive tests an all positive related test including false ones.

PVPT = TP/TP + FP

Predictive Value Negative of Negative test is the proprtion of Acutal diseased people over the sum of all negative related test results

PVNT = TN/TN+FN

This is saying out of all negative tests, how many are true.

Afterwards prevalence can be measured, so its the amount of actually disease people over the population

and Apprent prevalence is the ratio of people who test positve over the population

True Prevalence = ==TP+FN==/N
Apparent Prevalence = TP+FP/N

# Chapter 11 The Infectious Diseases Process

## 11.1 The Infectious Disease Process

Reasons to study Infectious diseases epidemiology is to control new agents and act against bioterrorism, and to Illustrate general principles of epidemiology. 
Components of Infectious Disease Process Includes [[Agents]], [[Reservoir]], [[Portals of Entry and Exit]], [[Mode of Transmission]], and [[Immunity]]
### Agents

[[Infections]]' primary mechanism is that a small organism or parasite multiplies within a host, which can be human or animal. We're all animals though.
Infectious agents on a surface is [[Contamination]]
[[Infections]] are not [[Infectious Diseases]], "many infections remain inapparent". [[Disease]] within natural history is categorized as onset of symptoms.
[[Infectious Agents]] are classified by size, structure, physiology. They seem to be all living agents of different [[Phyla]], [[Kingdoms]], [[Species]], etc.
[[Pathology]]

### Reservoirs

[[Reservoir]] are habitats agents can live and multiply in. The [[Host]] can become the reservoir because technically it allows the agent to live and grow.

![[Inapparent Carriers]] 

![[Incubatory Carriers]]

![[Convalescent Carriers]]

#### Inanimate Objects

[[Matter]] such as water, food, soil, air, and other substances can just be a substrate for [[Agents]]. Viruses can just be floating around in water.

### Transmission

[[Transmission]] is any mechanism that transfers agents to another host. Transmission occurs between [[Portals of Entry and Exit]], and the intermediate can be any of the following: direct/indirect contact, [[Vectors]], and [[Vehicles]].

Indirect contact is like touching someone's saliva and putting it in any of your portals. Sneezing is also indirect.

[[Vectors]] are living objects that can transmit the agents in question, [[Vehicles]] are inanimate objects. Vehicles include food and water.

[[Serial Transfer]] is based on the concept that transmission happens sequentially between individual to individual. Example can include [[Sexually Transmitted Diseases]] such as [[Herpes]] that spread person to person via direct contact

### Host Immunity

#### Types of Immunity

[[Immunity]] are all the factors that alter the likelihood of infection and disease in host once the agent is encountered. It includes two types: [[Innate Immunity]] and [[Acquired Immunity]].

#### Immunization

[[Immunization]] is act of acquiring immunity through contact with a foreign substance or agent, this can be though vaccinations or arranged contact with disease in question.

[[Vaccines]] can be [[Toxoid Vaccines]], [[Subunit Vaccines]], and [[Inactivated Vaccines]]. All different solutions for antibodies in individual to develop a mechanism of defense.

## 11.2 Herd Immunity

### What is Herd Immunity

[[Herd Immunity]] is defined as the proportion of resistant individuals in the population being observed. The basic concept is that at a specific amount of resistant individuals can interrupt [[Serial Transfer]] within a population.
The previous ideas of [[Innate Immunity]] and [[Acquired Immunity]] can be applied to the larger scale of the herd. The proportion in this case is proportion of individuals that are innately resistant to diseases to population.

# Chapter 12 Outbreak Investigation 

## 12.1 Background

### Initial detection of outbreaks

- Affected individuals report unusual outcomes to public health authorities
- Epidemiological surveillance systems warn of emerging health problems

Outbreaks are another word for [[Epidemic]], where epidemic means an increase rate beyond a normal one within a population. 

[[Epidemiologic Surveillance Systems]] are organizations and structures that collect and analyze outcome specific health data.

Outbreak investigation has a few factors to warrant it. Quantitatively confirm the epidemic, check the severity, see if there's a disproportion that affects a subgroup, potential for spread, ethics, and availability of resources.

The check list is about five factors long.

### Goals and methods of outbreak investigation

1. Asses range and extent of the outbreak
2. Reduce number of cases associated with outbreak by identifying and eliminating source
3. Identify new disease syndromes
4. Identify new causes of known disease syndromes
5. Assess the efficacy of current strat
6. Address liability concerns

## 12.2 CDC Prescribed Investigatory Steps

### Step 1: Prepare for Field Work

### Step 2: Establish the existence of an outbreak

Look for common cause or even the [[Necessary Causal Factors]]
Eliminate bias 

### Steps 3 and 4: Verify Diagnoses of cases and search for additional cases

Investigation team looks through unidentified cases in hospitals

Correlation does not equal causation
Cross section studies cannot conclude causality
[[Birth Cohort]] mimics birth cohorts

Corhot studies
Classify exposed and non exposed
Follow them over time
compar risk or rate of disease

### Chapter 8

Longitudinal refers to time line
Case-Control
Comparing diseased and non diseased
Looking at groups of people and check their history
Case control studies are always retreospective

Idefnitfy cases in source population
Select random non cases form same source population
Check what exposure was or reason

$R_{0}$ not avaiable, so odds are used in case control studies

Source Population A Seattle Area HMO
175 Histologically confirmed porstate cancer cases, must be clinically confirmed
258 Similary aged men slected at random fro msource population (controls)

Exposure

#### Identifying Cases

Incidence cases are preferred
Prevalent cases
Srouces of cases
	Typically caoem population seruvellances or valid ways such as hospitals, death cert, health records, pharmacy
Cases stay in studies because they want to wah wah wah 
Maximum efficiency of 1 control to 1 case

#### Good Infomration

Qualitfy of study depends on garbage in garbage out
Gather infomration for cases and controls in identical manners, blinded review i sbest to avoid bias
Data collection forms
It should be done simply
Data should be collected consistently

## 2025 03 25

Three main studies

Cross Section Study
	Checks one point in time
	Looks at exposure and Disease
	Check for strength of relationship between exposure and disease
	Surveys should or can as a bunch of questions to look at correlation with disease and exposure
Cohort Study
Case-Control Study

The last three mentioned ones are observational
Chohort and case control studies are longitudinal

Tracking cohort longintudental wise
Check and compare exposure plus and exposure negative

Check multiple diseases and relation to exposures

Case control only focuses one one disease, and focuses on the retrospective aspect

### Experimental Studies

6.1 Introduciton

#### Epi Experiments

Commonly referred as trials
	Can include clinical trial, field trial, and community trial
Clinical trial tests therapeutic intervention applies to individuals
Field trials tests preventative interventions
Community Trial tests interventions at a aggregate level, put fluoride in one district and not the other to check rates of cavities
	This would be an ecological study 

Clinic trials and the assignment 
1.28 times the risk of developing coronary heart disease
0.66 = RR
Compared to the villages wihtout Vitamin A supplementation prgoram, the the villages with the vitamin A supplementation programs had 2/3's the risk of child mortality 

RD = Compared to the unexposed group, the exposed group has 2.47 less mortalities per 1000 children

#### Simple Analysis: Efficacy

Is the Same as RR without the minus sign

#### Natural Experiments

Cannot be tru experiments because the intervetion was not allocated by protocol

#### Selected Concepts Experimental Design

#### Treatment Group and Control Group

Effects of exposure can only be judged in comparison to what would happen in its absence

#### Illustration MRFIT

Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial

#### Polio Field Trials 1954

Refuser tend to do less risker, protection based on world view and behavior
Vaccinated group may do risker things
Dont do trials were people openly accept stuff

#### Placebo Effect

Placebo effect may encourage better preventive charge
Placebo has an equalizing effect on people

#### The Hawthorne Effect

Behaviors can change in groups if they know if they are being watched

#### Randomization and Comparability

Randomization is used balance things out in groups

#### Follow-Up & OUtcome Ascertainment

Follow up with screening for study outcomes and confirming the outcomes as true
Study outcomes should be based on case defininations and valid criteraia

Important of blinding
	Single Blinding is just the subject
	Double Blinding is Provider 
	Triple Blinding is blinding the "sponsors"

#### Intention to treat vs per protocol analysis

Clincal trial
Test
100 smokers
50 standard care
50 new intervetion

Per protocol analysis takes what you have and interpret numbers that exists disregarding any changes

10 people leave in the 50 new inteverion, we dont know what happened to them

Intention to treat keeps the original number of people
Per Protocol uses what even new values that occur
