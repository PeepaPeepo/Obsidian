- In the scenario of two of the same [[Molecules|molecules]] are joined by a single bond, or $\sigma$ bond, they have different orientations relative to each other, like free weights of a barbell
- Looking at Ethane, $\ce{ CH_{3} - CH_{3} }$
- There are technically an infinite amount of orientations they can have
- It depends on [[Torsional Angle]]
- The orientations relative to each other can be eclipsed or staggered
- Specific orientations are more stable than eclipsed conformations
