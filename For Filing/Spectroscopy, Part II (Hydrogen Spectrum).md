Dry Lab

Explore mathematical basis for the relation between [[Electromagnetic Radiation|Electromagnetic Energy]] , [[Energy]] , and atomic spectrum of hydrogen atoms

# Reminders

All of the tables, calculations, and questions described in the handout must be included in your lab notes
graphs should be printed

# Dispersion of Light from a Gas Discharge Tube Filled with Hydrogen

[[Prism]]
[[Emission Spectra]]
Typically shows visible range

Complete the following table and plot it on excel
x axis is 1/n^2
1/lambda on y

Generate trend line from excel

y=mx +b 

$\ce{ \frac{1}{\lambda} =R_{h}\left( \frac{1}{n_{1}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{2}^2} \right) }$

Both should both be positive, non-zero integers
$\ce{ n_{low} }$ must not equal nhgih
nlow should be should be lower

Planck's constant is h=6.626 x 10^-34 js
c = 2.988 x 10^8 m/s

Calculate the energy of the photon in J
