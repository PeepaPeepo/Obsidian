[[Fructose]] is a [[Disaccharides|Disaccharide]] formed by a [[Glucose|D-Glucose]] [[Monomers]] and a [[Fructose|D-Fructose]] [[Monomers]] joined together by a $\alpha$ 1' - $\beta$ 2' [[Glycosidic Linkages]], which can be called a head to head linkage. The [[Dehydration Synthesis|Dehydration Reaction]] happens between the [[Hydroxyl Groups|Hydroxyl Groups]] connected to the D-Glucose and D-Fructose [[Anomeric Carbons]].
