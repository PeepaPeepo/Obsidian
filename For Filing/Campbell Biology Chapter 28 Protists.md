## Concept 28.1 Most euk are single celled

[[Protists]] is informal term to refer to all euk that are not plants, animals or fungi
No longer considered a kingdom because some protists are closelsy related to plants and fungi
Have [[Cell Nucleus]]
[[Organelles]] isolate functions within eukarytotic cells
HAve well developed cytoskeleton, important in [[Mitosis]] and [[Meiosis]]
Most are [[Unicellular Organisms]]
Some [[colonial]]
and [[Multicellular Organisms]]
Univcellular are most complex
[[Ocelloid]] are phototrophic

## Structural and function

[[Photoautotrophs]]
[[Heterotrophs]]
[[Mixotrophs]]
Some protists are asexual
basic types of sexual life cycles, animal, plant, and fungal

## Endosymbiosis

[[Endosymbiosis]] evolution in protists

## Plastid Evolution: a Closer Look

Evolution of [[Mitochondria]] gave rise to [[Eukarya|Eukaryotes]]
[[Plastids]] arose later when heterotrophic eukaryote engulfed a photosynthetic cyanobacterium
Two lineages of photosynthetic protists
[[Red Algae]] and [[Green Algae]]

## Exploing Protistan diversity

[[Excavata]] supgergroup includes [[Parabasalids]], 
[[Stramenopila Alveolata Rhizaria]] includes [[Stramenopila]], [[Alveolata]], and [[Rhizaria]]
	[[Diatoms]] are important photsynthetic stramenopiles
[[Archaeplastida]] includes red and Green Algae
	Includes unicellular, colonial, and multicellular species
[[Unikonta]] includes [[Amoebas]] with lobe or tube shaped pseudopodia

## Protistan Diversity

[[Haptophytes]], [[Cryptophytes]]

## Concept 28.2 Excavates include protists with modified mitochondria and protists with flagella

[[Excavata]] characterized by [[Cytoskeletons]]
[[Parabasalids]] Trichomonas vaginalis is stp

[[Euglenozoans]] is a diverse clade includes predatory hterotropss
Spiral or crystalline rod in each flagella
includes the [[Kinetoplastids]]
	have single mito
	Organized mass of DNA called [[Kinetoplast]]
	Free living consumers of prokar
	Some are parasites
	[[Trypanosoma]] 

[[Euglenids]] have one or two flagella that emerge from a pocket at one end of the cell
some are mixtrophs
has an Eyespot

## Concept 28.3: Sart is a hihgly diverse group of protists defined by DNA

[[Stramenopila Alveolata Rhizaria]] is [[Monophyletic Groups|monophyletic]] super group named for three major clades
[[Stramenopila]] are mostly hairy flagellum paird with smooth
[[Diatoms]], [[Oomycetes]], and [[Brown Algae]] are the important groups
Produces nutrients
[[Diatoms]] have glass like wall of [[Silicon Dioxide]]
can within high pressure

## Brown Algae

[[Brown Algae]] are the largest and most complex multicelluar algae
[[Carotenoids]] in the [[Plastids]] that produce the brown color
most are marine

Have holdfast, stipe, and blade

## Alternation of Generations

Have [[Haploid]] then [[Diploid]] 
Diploid generation is [[Sporophyte]]
Haploid spores develop into [[Gametophytes]]
[[Heteromorphic]] speices have different game and sporophyte
[[Isomorphic]] have have gametophytes and sporophyte that looks identical

## Oomycetes, water molds and relatives

[[Oomycetes]] include water molds, white rusts, and downly mildews
Misidentified as fungi due to their multinucleate
Cell walls made of Cellulose rather than chitin

## Alveolates

[[Alveolates]] have enclosed sacs just under the plasma membrane
Three clads
	[[Dinoflagellate]]
	Red tides are toxic and cause massive kills of invertebrates
	[[Apicomlexans]]
	[[Cilates]]
		Have cilia to move around

[[Apicomlexans]]

Most life cycles include both sexual and asexual stages and require tow or more different hosts
[[Ciliates]] are named for their use of [[Cilia]] to move around the feed on bacteria
Cilia may completely cover teh cell surface or be clustered in a few
[[Conjugation]] produces genetic variation without reproduction through the exchange of [[Micronuclei]]
[[Binary Fission]] is aesexual

## Rhizarians

[[Rhizaria]] are amoebas
Feed using [[Pseudopodia]]
Three clades
[[Radiolarians]] have delicate symmetrical internal skeeltons

[[Foraminiferans]] named for prosou calcium carbonate shells called tests

[[Cerocozoans]] are amoeboid and flagellated protists feed using threadlike pseudopodia
There are common in marine, fresh water, and soil ecosystems

## Concept 28.4 Red and Gree Algae are closest relative

plants are descended from the green algae
[[Archaeplastida]] are a super group

[[Red Algae]] have [[Phycoerythrin]] that masks green chlorophyll
Most are multicelluar , the largests are seaweeds

Humans eat Porphyra

[[Green Algae]] are named for gree nchloroplasts
Paraphyletic group includes [[Charophytes]] and the [[Chlorophytes]]

Larger size and greater complexity in threee different mech

formation of colonies
form multicellular bodies
repeeated divisoin of nuclei
Most chlorophytes hava complex life cylces wiht both sexual and asexula 

## Concept 28.5 Unikonts include protists that are closesly related to fungi

[[Unikonta]] includes animals, fungi, and some protists
[[Amoebozoans]]
[[Opisthokonts]], animals, fungi, and related protists

[[Unikonta]] rooth tree is uncertain
First group to diverge from other eukaryote groups

[[Amoebozoans]] are amoebas that have lobe or tube shake
Includes [[Tubulinids]], [[Slime Molds]], and [[Entamoebas]]

[[Slime Molds]] or [[Mycetozoans]] were once thought to be fungi
[[Plasmodium]]

## Cellular Slime Molds

Cells in the stalk of the fruiting body die without reproducting
Some cells have a cheat mutation
Cheating cells lack specific surface protein
Nonceahters avoid exploitation
Recognition system may have been repoted in the evolution of other multicelluar cells

[[Entamoebas]] are parasites
Humans are hosts to at least six species

# Opisthokonts

[[Opisthokonts]] are groups that iclude plants, fungi...
## Concept 28.6 Protists play key roles in ecological communities

Protists play two key roles in their habittats
[[Symbionts]] and that of [[Producers]]
[[Dinoflagellates]] live within the polyps and nourhs reef corals
Corals are animals
Convert CO2 to organic compounds



[[Prokaryotes]] are singled cell organisms that make up domains of [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]
They can thrive in extreme enviornments

# Concept 27.1 Structural and Functional Adaptations contribute to prokaryotic Success

First organisms to inhabit earth were [[Prokaryotes]]
3.5 biollion years ago
Most prokaryotes are [[Unicellular Organisms]]
Cells of some species remained attached to each other after division
Typical diameters of 0.5 - 5 uM
Much smaller than 10 - 100 um of [[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] cells
*Thiomargarita namibiensis* is an exception

## Cell surface structure

[[Cell Walls]] maintains shape, protects, and prevents [[Hypotonic]] environments
[[Hypertonic]] environments takes away water from wall and inhibits cell reproduction
Salt can be used to preserve foods because it causes food spoiling prokaryotes to lose water, preventing reproduction
[[Bacteria|Bacterial]] [[Cell Walls]] contains [[Peptidoglycan]], a polymer composed of modified sugars cross linked by short polypeptides
It encloses the entire bacterium and anchors other molecules that extend from it 
[[Archaea|Archael]] cell walls contain a variety of [[Polysaccharides]] and [[Proteins]] but no [[Peptidoglycan]]
[[Gram Stain]] categorizes bacterial species based on cell wall composition
Stained with dye and iodine, then red dye safranin to bind to NA
[[Gram-Positive]] have thick later of peptoglycan
[[Gram-Negative]] have less peeptidoglycan contains lipopolysaccharides
Lipid portions of [[Lipopolysaccharides]] in gram negative bacteria are toxic causing fever or shock
They are resistance to body defense
Some mgram positive species have virulent strains that are resistant to some antibiotics
[[Penicillin]] inhibits [[Peptidoglycan]] cross linking to inhibit function

Cell wall of prokaryotes have a [[Capsule]] which is a sticky layer of [[Polysaccharides]] or [[Proteins]] if it is dense and defined, or a [[Slime Layer]]
Protents from dehydration

Bacterial can develop [[Endospores]] cells when lacking water or nutrients to withstand harsh conditions

Original cell produces a copy of its chromosome and surrounds that copy with a multlayer structure

realsing endo spore

Can resist temps upto 121 un der high pressure

[[Fimbriae]] are appendages that lets it attach to things
