[[Beta Pleated Sheets]] are [[Secondary Structures]] of [[Proteins]] that determined by interactions of the sequence of [[Amino Acids]] in a [[Polypeptides]]. Beta pleated sheets are laid out anti-parallel from each other creating high frequency [[Hydrogen Bonds]]. 

They make up the core of many [[Globular Proteins]]. Beta pleated sheets can link alpha helices, randomness can be helped with [[Proline]] and [[Glycine]].
