[[Climate]] climate is temperature and precipitation
Light and nutrients

[[Ecology]] is the scientific study of interactions of organisms of living adn nonliving

# Figure 52.2 Exploring the scope of ecological research

Organaismal Ecology focuses on strugture and physio

[[Population Ecology]]

Population is a group of individuals in teh same
Ecology analyze factors affecting population size and why it changes over time

[[Community Ecology]] examines the effect of interspecific interactions on community structure
[[Ecosystems]] is a community of organisms in an area, emphasizes energy flow and chemical cycling between organisms and the environment

[[Landscape Ecology]] mosaic of connected ecosystem
Focuses on exchanges of energy, materials, and orgaisms across multiple ecosystems

[[Global Ecology]] The Biosphere is the global ecosystem
Examines exchange of energy and material influence on funtion

# Concept 52.1: Earth's climate varies by latitude and season and is changing rapidly

Long-term prevailing weather conidtions in an area consitute is [[Climate]]
[[Climate]] is the most significat influence on the distrubtion of orgaisms on land
Temperature, precipitation, sunglight, and wind

Global climate patterns

Solar energy and earth's movment in space
Warming effect of sun establishes temp variation
Latitudinal variations
Latitude is "horizontal"

Intensity of sunlight is affected by angle of impact
Sunlight is most direct and therefore most intnese in the tropics
Higher latitudes sunglight hits and oblique angle

Equator is more constant
Sun overhead at equionxes

Global Air Circulation and Precipitation Patterns

Air circulation and preciptiation patterns 
Intense light causes evaporation
Wet air masses
High precipitation in the [[Tropics]]
Desceneding iar masses create arid climates
Air masses release abundant precipitation

Interaction between tropics and neighboring biomes

## Global Air Circulation and Precipitation Patterns

[[Global Wind Patterns]] air flow close to earth's surface
Speed of rotation is faster near equator, casuing deflection of windws from vertical path

# Regional and Local Effects on Climates

[[Seasonality]] in middle to high latitudes is caused by the tilt of earth's axis of rotation

# Bodies of water

Oceans Currents influence the climate of nearby terrestial enviornments by heating or cooling overlying air masses

Currents flowing toward the equator carry cold water from the poles
Water moderates climate of nearby land due to the highspefic heat of water

# Mountains

Influence airflow over land and affect climate in surrounding areas
Warm moist air cools as it rises up a mountain and releases moisture on the windward side
Cool dry air absorbs moisture as it descnets on the leeward side creaing a rain shadow
Many deserts are found in teh rain shadows of the mountains
Affects amount of light
Northern hemisphere south facing slopes are warmer and drier because they recive more sunlight

# Effects on Vegetation on Climate

Terrestrial organisms particularly [[Forests]] can alter climate
Darker color absorbs more solar energy than desert or grasslands
Warming efffect is offsett by Transpiration which causes evaporative cooling
Reduces surface temperature and increases precipitation rates 
Climate becomes hotter and drier in areas where humans cut down forests

[[Microclimates]] referes to fine localized patterns in climate
	Areas casting shade, altering evaporation from soil, or chaning wind patterns 
Characeterized by difference in in [[Abiotic Factors]] factors
Humidity, 
[[Biotic Factors]] or lving factors other organisms that are part of an individuals enviorment

# Global Climate Change

Burning of fossil bfuels 
[[Climate Change]]
$\ce{ CO_{2} }$ CH4 NO3 H2O O3
[[Enhaced Greenhouse Gases]]
Increase is altering climate change

[[Biomes]] are major life zones characterized by vegtation type or physical enviormenate
[[Climate]] is a major factor determing the lcoatios of terrestial biomes

[[Climograph]] plots annual mean [[Temperature]] and [[Precipitation]] in a region
[[Biomes]] are affected not just by mean temp, but also pattern of temp and precip
