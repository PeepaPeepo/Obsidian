## 5.1 Introduction to Etiologic Research

Epi Hypotheses

1. Studies should address defined research hypothesis or research question
2. Hypotheses must be based o nsound causal mechanisms in specfic terms that can be tested
3. Hypotheses are refinement as new information becomes available

### Hypothesis Statement

Needs a broad question that you want answer
Selected elements of an epi research question

1. Source Population
2. Exposure variable
3. Disease variable
4. Confounding variables
5. Dose response
6. Time response sample size

### Variable Yaz Example

[[Confounders]]

### Ethnics: Studying Human Subjects

Institutional review board review if humans who engage are protected.
[[Informed Consent]] is important 
[[The Belmont Report]] is a guideline for human case study 
Casualties are bad
[[Data Safety Monitoring Board]] checks if outcomes are good or bad, or outweighs goal

### Equipoise

[[Equipoise]] is balanced doubt
Cannot expose a participate to harm, like smoking
Cannot withhold known benefit to subjects

### Selected Study Design Elements

[[Referent Group]] Only judge effects of an exposure relative to the baseline determined by referent or control group

### Experimentation

How was exposure assigned?
Experimental study is a assignment or 
Observational study classify

### Unit of Observation

### Longitudinal v X-Sectional

Longitudinal follows a group over time

# Chapter 7
## 7.1 Introduction

Needs cohort study
Classify as exposed or non-exposed
Retro spective cohort studies

Correlation does not equal causation
Cross section studies cannot conclude causality
[[Birth Cohort]] mimics birth cohorts

Corhot studies
Classify exposed and non exposed
Follow them over time
compare risk or rate of disease

# Chapter 8

Longitudinal refers to time line
Case-Control
Comparing diseased and non diseased
Looking at groups of people and check their history
Case control studies are always retreospective

Idefnitfy cases in source population
Select random non cases form same source population
Check what exposure was or reason

$R_{0}$ not avaiable, so odds are used in case control studies

Source Population A Seattle Area HMO
175 Histologically confirmed prostate cancer cases, must be clinically confirmed
258 Similar aged men selected at random for source population (controls)

Exposure

## Identifying Cases

Incidence cases are preferred
Prevalent cases
Sources of cases
	Typically control population seruvellances or valid ways such as hospitals, death cert, health records, pharmacy
Maximum efficiency of 1 control to 1 case

## Good Information

Quality of study depends on garbage in garbage out
Gather information for cases and controls in identical manners, blinded review is best to avoid bias
Data collection forms
It should be done simply
Data should be collected consistently
