[[Chemical Nomenclature]] is used to determine chemical names of [[Ionic Compounds]], [[Molecular Compounds]], and [[Binary Acids]] and [[Oxyacids]].

# Ionic Compounds

[[Ionic Compounds]] names depends on if the [[Metals]] are [[Main Group Elements]] or [[Transition Elements]].

Names of successive nonmetals have their name end in -ide, this suffix can be applied to molecular compounds and polyatomic molecules.

## Binary Ionic Compounds with One type of Cation

[[Ionic Compounds]] are [[Molecules]] with [[Ionic Bonds]] that form, by definition, between [[Metals]] and [[Nonmetals]]. Making sure that the charges neutralize each other, the naming convention for [[Binary Ionic Compounds]] between [[Main Group Elements]] goes as follows:

Name of Metal + (Base Name of Nonmetal + -ide)

Barium Chloride

## Binary Ionic Compounds with multiple types of Cation

[[Transition Elements|Transition Metals]] can have unpredictable charges and can be named via [[Stock System]]; using the [[Numeral Prefixes]] to indicate their charge.

Iron (II) Chloride
Iron (II) = $\ce{ Fe^2+ }$

# Molecular Compounds

[[Molecular Compounds]] are [[Compounds]] that only contain [[Nonmetals]]. Naming them only require giving the [[Elements]] [[Numeral Prefixes]]. 

$\ce{ P_{2}O_{5} }$ is ***Di***phosphorus ***Penta***oxide

Successive nongases change the ends of their names to -ide similar to the rule of [[Ionic Compounds]].

## Naming Binary Molecular Compounds

[[Binary Molecular Compounds]] consists of only two [[Elements]] and has similar naming to [[Binary Ionic Compounds]].

The least [[Electronegativity|Electronegative]] is written first.  

# Acids

[[Acids]] are [[Compounds]] that contain H and one or more nonmetal, If the compound only contains H and one other nonmetal they are [[Binary Acids]], if it contains any O they are [[Oxyacids]].

[[Molecular Compounds]] that contain at least one [[Hydrogen]] and produces [[Hydrogen Ion]] in water can be categorized as acid. 

## Naming Binary Acids

[[Binary Acids]] consists of only hydrogen and one other element.

Hydro- + (Base Name of Nonmetal + -ic) + Acid

Hydrochloric Acid

## Naming Oxyacids

[[Oxyacids]] consists of Hydrogen, Oxygen, and typically [[Nonmetals]]

[[Polyatomic Ions]] that end with "-ite" change to "-ous"

$\ce{ SO_{3}^2- }$ is Sulfate, when in an acid becomes Sulfur***ous*** Acid.

[[Polyatomic Ions]] that end with "-ate" change to "-ic"
