### Diversification in Plants

Most plants have [[Vascular Tissues]] that transports water and nutrients and are called [[Vascular Plants]]
[[Bryophytes]] are [[Nonvascular Plants]] and includes: [[Liverworts]], [[Mosses]], [[Hornworts]]
[[Seedless Vascular Plants]] lack seeds and include two [[Clades]]: [[Lycophytes]] and [[Monilophytes]].
	[[Lycophytes]] are [[Club Mosses]] and relatives
	[[Monilophytes]] are ferns and relatives
[[Seed]] is are [[Embryos]] backed with nutrients in a coat; it contains [[Gymnosperms]] and [[Angiosperms]]

### Major Groups of Plants

[[Nonvascular Plants]] ([[Bryophytes]])
	[[Liverworts]] have liver shaped [[Gametophytes]]
	[[Mosses]] have 'visible to naked eye' [[Sporophyte]] 
	[[Anthocerotophyta|Hornworts]] have horn shaped [[Sporophyte]]

[[Vascular Plants]] have [[Sporophyte]] that live away from [[Haploid Gametophytes]]
	Life cycle with dominant [[Sporophyte]]
	[[Vascular Tissues]] such as [[Xylem]] and [[Phloem]]
	[[Roots]] and [[Leaves]]
	Spore bearing leaves called [[Sporophylls]]
	[[Lycophytes]]
	[[Sporophyte]] of Ferns are the visible leafy plants, but the [[Gametophytes]] are tiny plants growing on or below soil surface.
[[Gametangia]] vs [[Sporophylls]] 
[[Seedless Vascular Plants]] are [[Homosporous]]
All [[Seed Plants]] and some [[Seedless Vascular Plants]] are [[Heterosporous]]
	Two different [[Sporophylls]] bearing different [[Sporangia]] to produce different spore types

## Chapter 30 Plant Diversity II The Evolution of Seed Plants

Adaptations to life on Land
	[[Seeds]] consists of [[Embryos]] and [[Nutrients]] surrounded by a protective coat.
	[[Pollen Grain]] 
	Reduced [[Gametophytes]]
		Development within cones in [[Gymnosperms]]
		Development within flowers in [[Angiosperms]]
		Seed plant life is [[Sporophyte Dominated]], gametophytes are microscopic and dependent
			[[Gametophytes]] develop from [[Spores]] retained within [[Sporangia]] of the [[Sporophyte]]
			They are protected from environmental stress and receive nutrients from the parent sporophyte
	[[Heterosporous]] vs [[Homosporous]]
		[[Homosporous]] produce one kind of spore, and have bisexual [[Gametophytes]]
		[[Heterosporous]] plants produce two types, either male or female
		[[Ferns]] and close relatives are [[Homosporous]]
		[[Seed Plants]] are [[Heterosporous]]
		[[Spores]] develop within [[Sporangia]] on [[Sporophylls]] 
			[[Megasporophylls]]
			[[Microsporophylls]]
		Ovules and Production of Eggs
			[[Ovule]] contain [[Megaspores]] within [[Megasporangia]] protected by [[Integuments]]
				Gymnosperm have one integuments
				Angiosperm have two integuments
		Pollen and Production of Sperm
			[[Microspores]] from [[Microsporangia]] are enclosed within in a pollen wall called a [[Pollen Grain]]
			[[Pollination]] is the transfer of pollen to the part of a seed plant containing the ovules
			Pollen grains germinated when reaching [[Megasporophylls]]
			[[Pollen Tubes]] formation that grows into ovule and discharges sperm into female gametophyte
		Evolutionary Advantage of Seeds
			[[Zygotes]] turn into [[Sporophyte Embryo]]
				[[Ovule]] develops into a seed
				Seeds and spores provide protection
[[Gymnosperms]]
	Life Cycle of a Pine
		Have naked seeds exposed on [[Sporophylls]] of [[Cones]]
		Most gymnosperms are cone bearing plants called [[Conifers]]
		It produces [[Sporangia]] in male and female [[Cones]]
		Pollen cones are small and have [[Microsporophylls]] and [[Microsporangia]]
			[[Microsporocytes]] undergo meiosis to produce [[Microspores]]
		Microspores turn into [[Pollen Grain]]
		Cones release pollen
		[[Ovulate Cones]] contain [[Megasporophylls]] and [[Megasporangia]] that have [[Megasporocytes]] that tern into [[Megaspores]] which turn into gametophytes
		Trees can have male and female cones
		It takes nearly three years from the first appearance of cones to produce seeds
	Major Groups
		[[Cycadophyta]]
			[[Flagella|Flagellated]] [[Sperms]]
			Endangered
		[[Ginkgophyta]]
			*[[Ginkgo biloba]]* is the only species of the phylum
			They have flagellated Sperm
			Tolerates air pollution
			Female seeds stink
		[[Gnetophyta]]

			Some are tropical and some are desert
			*Welwitschia* can be found in deserts
			*Ephedra* produce [[Ephedrine]]
			*Gnetum* looks like flowering plants
		[[Coniferophyta]]
			Largest phylum
			Woody Cones
			Needle like and scale like leaves

		Flowers are for sex
			Contain [[Sepals]]
			[[Petals]] attract pollinators
			[[Stamens]] are [[Microsporophylls]]
			[[Carpels]] are [[Megasporophylls]]
		Seed development lead to ovarian wall thickening into a fruit
		Flesh or dry fruits 
		Dispersion via animals
	Life Cycle
		Angiosperms can self pollinate
		Pollen tubes penetrate [[Micropyle]], a pore in the [[Integuments]] and shoots out two [[Sperms]]
		[[Double Fertilization]]
			One sperm fertilizes egg to make a Diploid
			The remaining sperm fuses with two nuclei in the embryo sac to for ma triploid
		Turns into a seed
	Angiosperm diversity
		[[Monocots]] vs [[Dicots]]
			One or two cotyledon
