# Introduction

- Each element is made of a unique [[Atoms]]
	- Smallest unit of matter that retains element characteristics
	- Abbreviations used for elements are also for a single element atom

## Example

- $C$ is Carbon, and a single $C$ atom

# Subatomic Particles

- Atoms are the smallest units that preserve element characteristics, but atoms are still made of [[Subatomic Particles]]
- Physicists were able to create 100 types of particles from particle collider
- Important parts of atoms are [[Neutrons]], [[Protons]], and [[Electrons]]
	- Protons and electrons are electrically charged
- Each proton has one unit of positive charge
- Each electron has one unit of negative charge
- Neutrons are electrically neutral
- Protons and neutrons are packed in a dense core called an [[Atomic Nucleus]]
- Rapid electrons form a cloud around the atomic nucleus creating a cloud of negative charge
- attraction between the electrons and protons maintain the cloud
- Review Atom diagram 

![[Pasted image 20230825093526.png]]

- Neutrons and Protons are identical in mass
	- about $1.7*10^{24}g$
- Unit of measure for atoms and subatomic particles is dalton
	- Named after John Dalton
- Alternate units for a dalton is [[Atomic Mass Units]]
- Mass of an electron is 1/2000 of a neutron/proton
- Omit electron mass during computation
# Atomic Numbers and Atomic Mass (31)

- All elements have a unique number of [[Subatomic Particles]]
- Atoms of the same [[Elements|element]] will have the same number of [[Protons]]
- The number of protons and element has is called an [[Atomic Number]]
	- Written in subscript left of the element symbol
- $_2HE$ means it has 2 protons, and it implies they are neutral unless otherwise stated
	- It needs the respective amount of [[Electrons]] to balance the charge
- The atomic number states the number of proton/electron in a neutral atom
- Number of neutrons can be calculated from the [[Mass Numbers]]
	- Total number of protons and neutrons in an [[Atomic Nucleus]]
	- Written as a super script left of the element in question
	- Neutrons can be found by the difference of the atomic number and the mass number
- Electron mass is small in comparison, it doesn't affect net mass
- Neutrons and Protons have a mass very close to 1 dalton
- Different from the [[Atomic Masses]]

## Example

$^{23}_{11}Na$

- Mass number is 23
	- The total number of protons and neutrons
- Atomic Number is 11
	- The total number of electrons in a neutral atom
- Number of protons is the difference between mass number and atomic number

# Isotope (31)

- Some [[Atoms|atoms]] can have different ratios of [[Subatomic Particles]]
- Some can have more [[Neutrons]], and it increases mass
- The different forms are called [[Isotopes]]
	- It's a variance of form of an atom
	- Carbon can come in different masses
	- but it will always need 6 protons to be a Carbon
- carbon $^{12}C$ and $^{13}C$ are stable
	- They do not decay, or lose subatomic particles
- $^{14}C$ is not stable, it is radioactive
- [[Radioactive Isotope]] are atoms were its [[Atomic Nucleus]] can spontaneously decay
- If the atom changes in protons, it will change its element

# Radioactive Tracers (31)

- Radioactive isotopes are used in medical diagnostic tools
- Cells can used radioactive atoms like non-radioactive ones
- Radioactive cells are incorporated in bio active molecules
- Used as tracers to track metabolism
- Kidney disorders are monitored with tracer molecules excreted in urine

# Radiometric Dating (32)

- [[Parent Isotope]] decays into a [[Daughter Isotope]] at a fixed rate
- Expressed as [[Half-Life]]
	- The time it takes to decay to half of its life
	- isotope characteristic not affected by other variables like temp, pressure, or other environmental variable
- Measures different isotopes and calculate how many half-lives years have passed since a fossil or rock has been formed
- Half Lives vary by isotope
- Uranium-238 has half life of 4.5

# The Energy Levels of Electrons (32)

- During chemical reactions, atomic nuclei don't even come close to each other
- Mostly electrons interact
- Atom's electrons have different Energy levels
- [[Energy]] is the capacity to change
- [[Potential Energy]] is energy matter posses because of its location or or structure
- Electrons have potential energy due to its attraction to protons/positively charged nucleus
- ![[Pasted image 20230827192929.png]]
- The greater distance from nucleus, the more potential energy an electron has
- Changes of potential energy changes in fixed amounts
- electrons can only exist at certain energy levels
- Electron energy level is based on distance from [[Atomic Nucleus]]
- Electrons can be found at a different [[Electron Shells]]
	- Each have average distance and energy level
	- An electron can change shells only if it receives or gives energy equal to the difference of the shells
	- When electron absorbs energy  it moves away from the nucleus
- Light is source of energy that can move electrons
- When a nucleus looses energy, it's released to the environment has visible or uv radiation

# Electron Distribution and Chemical Properties

- Chemical behavior is depended on distribution of electrons in its shells
- [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]
	- Arranged in 3 rows or periods
	- Based on the electron shells in their atom
- Electrons like to stay in the lowest energy
- First shell cannot hold more than 2 electrons
- When a shell is full, the remainder goes to the next shell
- second shell holds 8 electrons
- Chemical behavior depends on the number electrons in the outermost shell
	- They are called [[Valance Electrons]] in the [[Valence Shells]]
	- 
- Atoms with same number of electrons in valence shells share similar chemical behavior
	- Cl and F have 7 valence electrons
	- Both can bind with Na
- Atom with completed valance shell is unreactive
	- will not react with other atoms
- Helium, Neon, and Argon are the only complete valence shell electrons
	- they are [[Inert]]
- All other atoms are chemically reactive because incomplete valance shells

# Electron Orbitals

- The 3d space where electron is found is called the [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]]
- Each electron shell has its own orbit
	- First shell (1s)- one spherical s orbital
	- Second Shell (2s) - Spherical and 3 dumbbell shaped p orbital
	- Third Shell (3s) - s, p orbital plus more
- 
![[Figure 2.8 Electron Orbitals.png]]

- No more than 2 electrons can occupy a single orbital per shell
- Second shell orbital is x,y,z, and s. = 2 each axis = 8 total electrons
- Reactivity comes from unpaired electrons in one or more orbitals in the valance shell
- 

#  CONCEPT CHECK 2.2

	- Valance electron is 7 like 
	- You need 1 more to fill

## 4. VISUAL SKILLS In Figure 2.7, if two or more elements are in the same row, what do they have in common? If two or more elements are in the same column, what do they have in common?
For suggested answers, see Appendix A

- Same row is number of shells
- each column has same number of valance electrons

# Next[[Campbell Biology Chapter 2 The Chemical Context of Life]]en Atoms]]





- Atoms with an incomplete [[Valence Shells]] can interact with other atoms that complete it
	- Either the partner atom can share or transfer electrons
- Atoms end up staying close together held by attraction called [[Chemical Bonds]]
- Strongest bonds are [[Covalent Bonds]] in molecules and [[Ionic Bonds]] in dry ionic compounds
	- Ionic bonds in aqueous, or water based, solutions are weak

# Covalent Bonds

- [[Covalent Bonds]] shares a pair of [[Valence Electrons]] by two atoms, known as a [[Single Covalent Bonds]]
- Hydrogen has 1 valance electron in 1s
- when 2 hydrogens are next to each other and overlap
- They can share electrons
- 2 or more atoms held by covalent bonds form a [[Molecules]]
- $H$ Valence Electron is attracted to other $H$ Atomic Nucleus
- Then overlapped their Valence Electrons fill the first shell forming a Covalent Bond
- Oxygen has 6 electrons in 2s and need 2 more to complete its valence shell
- Two oxgens form a molecule by sharing two pairs of valence electrons
- atoms create a [[Double Covalent Bonds]] $O=O$
- Each atom that can share valence electrons has a bonding capacity corresponding to the number of covalent bonds it can form
- The bonding capacity of Oxygen is 2
- The bonding capacity is called [[Atoms|Atom]]'s [[Valence]]
	- Usually equals the number to complete an atom's [[Valence Shells]]
- H = Valence is 1
- O = Valance is 2
- N = Valance is 3
- C = Valence is 4
- Phosphorus is complicated because it can make different single or double bonds
- Molecules like $H_2$ and $O_2$ are pure elements
- Compounds are combination of different elements
- [[Electronegativity]] attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond 
- The stronger electronegativity an atom has, the more strongly it pulls
- Covalent bonds between two of the same element has a neutral electronegativity
	- These are called a [[Nonpolar Covalent Bond]]
	- H_2 and O_2 does this
- When Covalent bonds are made into a compound, then each different atom creates a [[Polar Covalent Bonds]]
- Oxygen is the one of the most electronegative elements
- Oxygen in a water molecule has a partial negative charge and repped with d-, or “delta minus”
- Hydrogen has positive charges labeled as delta +

## Representing $H_2$ Molecules

	- $H_2$ 
	- the 2 represents the number of $H$ atoms
- [[Lewis Structures]]
	- $H:H$
	- Dots represents valence electrons 
- [[Structural Formulas]]
	- $H-H$
	- - = [[Single Covalent Bonds]] a pair of shared electrons
- [[Space-Filling Models]] is the closest representation
![[Pasted image 20230828110038.png]]

## Ionic Bonds

- Two atoms are so unequal in the attraction for valence electrons 
- Strips an electron away from partner
- It creates two oppositely charged atoms or molecules called [[Ions]]
	- Positively charged ion is a [[Cations]]
	- Negative Ion is an [[Anions]]
	- t in cation can be seen as a plus sign
	- Anion 'N's can be seen as negative
- The cations and anions attracted each other forming an [[Ionic Bonds]]
- The transfer of electrons is not the formation
- It allows the ionization of atoms that create the attraction
- Ions do not have to acquire charge from electron transfer
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 2.01.27 PM 1.png]]
- Na to Cl
	- Na Single Valence Electron Joins Cl's Vacant Space in Valence Shell
	- $Na$ turns into $Na+$ because there's more proton than electron
	- $Cl$ transforms into $Cl^-$ because there are more electrons than protons
- When the 2 atoms meet
	- The lone Na valence tranfers to Cl
	- The new valence shell of Na is S_2
	- Sodium with 11 Protons but now 10 electrons the + difference of protons turns Na in to a Cation
- Compounds formed by ionic bonds are called [[Ionic Compounds]] or [[Ionic Compounds|Salts]]
- Salts are often found in nature as crystals
- Salt crystals have vast numbers of cations
- Ionic compounds do not consist of molecules
- NaCl only indicates a ratio of elements
- Not all salts have equal anions:cations ratios
- $MgCl_2$ Magnesium chloride has two chloride to 1 Magnesium
- Magnesium turns into 2+ Mg to form with Cl-
- [[Ions]] applies to entire molecules that are charged
- NH_4Clantion is a single Cl-
- Nitrogen atom covalently bonded to four H, the whole ammonium ion has 1+
- Environtments affects teh strength of ionic bonds
- Dry salts are strgong
- But dissolved in water
	- ion is partially shielded by water
- A transfer of electrons create an Ion be it a Cation or an Anion

# Weak Chemical Interactions
