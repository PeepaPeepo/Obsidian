# Concept 9.1 Catabolic Pathways Yield Energy by Oxidizing Organic Fuels

Living cells need transfusions of energy to do work
Outside source is food
Food's energy is from the sun
Energy flows into an [[Ecosystems]] as sunlight and exits as [[Heat]]
[[Elements|Chemical Elements]] are recycled
[[Cellular Respiration]] breaks down fuel with oxygen and produce [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]
Waste of [[Carbon Dioxide]] and [[Water]] which are for [[Photosynthesis]]
[[Metabolic Pathways]] release stored energy by [[Catabolic Pathways]] which breaks molecules

## Catabolic Pathways and Production of ATP

[[Organic Molecules]] have bonds and when broken produces energy
Complex [[Organic Molecules]] or [[Polymers]] get broken down
Some energy comes out as work, some dissapates as heat
[[Fermentation]] is a partial degradation of [[Carbohydrates|Saccharides]], its a type of [[Catabolic Pathways]]
[[Aerobic Cellular Respiration]] is another form of [[Catabolic Pathways]]
[[Oxygen]] is consumed as [[Reactants]] with organic fuel
Definition sounds like a [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]]
Some prokaryotes use anything that isnt as oxygen and is called [[Anaerobic Respiration]]
[[Cellular Respiration]] includes both aerobic and anaboeric
It is synonmous with organism breathing
[[Carbohydrates]], [[Fats]], and [[Proteins]] can be used as fuel
[[Carbohydrates]] such as [[Starch]] breaks down into [[Glucose]]

$\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6 O_{2} -> 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + ATP + Heat }$

Breakdown of [[Glucose]] is [[Exergonic Reactions|Exergonic]]
$\ce{ -686 kcal }$ per mol of glucose

[[Catabolic Pathways]] do not directly work within a cell

## Redox Reactions: Oxidations and Reductions

Relocation of [[Electrons]] release [[Energy]] stored in [[Organic Molecules]] and the ergy is used to [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] ATP.

## The Principle of Redox

[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]] from one substance to another is [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]]
Addition of electrons to another reactant is the [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Reduction]]
Reduction refers to the reduction of positive electrons
Any reaction with pure $\ce{ O_{2} }$ gas is a [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]]

[[Reducing Agents]] donates [[Electrons]], that implices group 1A - 3A are reducing agents

[[Periodic Table of the Elements]]
[[Alkali Metals]]
[[Alkaline Earth Metals]]
3A



[[Oxidizing Agents]] receive [[Electrons]], implies that group 5A - 7A are oxidizing agents

Some change degree of electron sharing in covalent bonds
Methane reacing with O_2 and forming CO2 creates a [[Polar Covalent Bonds]]
Oxygen is one of the most powerful oxidizing agents

Electrons lose potential energy when it shifts from less electronegative atoms to more a more electronegative one

## Oxidation of Organic Fuel Molecules During Cellular Respiration

Oxidation of glucose and other moelcules are fuel

$\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2} -> 6 CO_{2} + 6 H_{2}O + Energy }$

$\ce{ 6 O_{2} -> 6H_{2}O }$ is a reduction of positive charge (gaining electrons)

$O_{2}$ gains more electrons from [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] of glucose
[[Organic Molecules]] with a lot of [[Hydrogen]] is a great source of hilltop electrons, which energy may be released as they fall down

Fuel with $\ce{ C-H }$ bonds oxidize into $\ce{ C-O }$
Main energy food are [[Carbohydrates]] and [[Fats]] and are reservoirs of [[Electrons]] associated with [[Hydrogen]] in the form of C-H bonds
Which sounds like [[Hydrocarbons]] 
Barrier of activation energy prevents flood of electrons
Body heat isn't enough to initiate burning of glucose

## Stepwise Energy Harvest via NAD+ and the Electron Transport Chain

Glucose is broken in a series of steps, each atalyzed by an enzyme. 
Hydrogen gets broken away from glucose and passed to an Electron carrier, a [[Coenzymes]] called [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide]], a type of a vitamin [[Niacin]]
It easily changes from NAD+ or NADH
[[Dehydrogenases]] remove a pair of neutral Hydrogen atoms from substrates such as [[Glucose]]
	But it delivers 2 electrons and 1 proton to [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] to form [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]]
	The other proton is released to the surrounding solution
![[Pasted image 20231206160039.png]]

Nicotinamide portion of [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] is neutralized by 2 electrons and 1 proton
Electrons lose little of their potential energy
Forming $H_{2}$ and $O_{2}$ provides a spark for activation energy
H in cellular respiration comes from organic molecules rather than H_2
[[Electron Transport Chains]] consist of multiple molcules, mostly proteins that lie within the inner [[Membranes]] of [[Mitochondria]] of [[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] cells
[[Electrons]] removed from glucose are shuttled by [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to the top part of the chain
The bottom of hte chain O_2 captures the electrons with a hydrogen to form water
[[Anaerobic Respiration]]
[[Electrons]] transfer from [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to oxygen is [[Exergonic Reactions|Exergonic]] with a free energy change of -53 kcal/mol
Electrons cascade down the chain one NADH at a time to a new series of redox reactions
Lossing small energy with each step util they get to oxygen
Terminal electron acceptor has affinity for electrons
Each step of teh chain is more attractive
From glucose to nad+ becomse NADH then go down the chain

[[Cellular Respiration]] most electrons travel teh following route

Glucose -> NADH -> Electron Transport Chain -> Oxygen

## The Stages of Cellular Respiration: A Preview

1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. [[Pyruvate Oxidation]]
   [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
3. [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]

[[Cellular Respiration]] refers to Stages 2 and 3
[[Glycolysis]], [[Pyruvate Oxidation]] and [[Citric Acid Cycle]] are [[Catabolic Pathways]]
[[Glycolysis]] occurs in the [[Cytosol]] and breaks down [[Glucose]] into [[Pyruvate]]
[[Pyruvate]] enters the [[Mitochondria]] and is oxidized to a compound called [[Acetyl Coenzyme A]] which enters the [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
Breaks down glucose to carbon dioxide 

Some steps of [[Glycolysis]] and [[Citric Acid Cycle]] are [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]]
[[Dehydrogenases]] transfer electrons from [[Substrates]] to [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] or related carrier [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide]] 

[[Electron Transport Chains]] accept electrons from [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH2]] and [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]]
The end of the chain the electrons are combined with Oxygen and hydrogen ions forming water
The energy released each step of the chain is stored in [[Mitochondria]] can be used to make ATP from ADP.

ATP Synthesis is called [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]] because it is powered by the redox reactions of the electron transport chain 

Inner membrane of [[Mitochondria]] is the site of electron transport and [[Chemiosmosis]] and both make up [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]

It accounts for 90% of ATP generated by respiration 
Smaller amount of ATP is formed by reactions of of [[Glycolysis]] and [[Citric Acid Cycle]] by mechanism called

[[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]] occurs when [[Enzymes]] transfer [[Phosphate Groups]] from [[Substrates]] ti [[Adenosine Diphosphate]] 

For each molecule of glucose degraded to CO2 and H2O, the cell makes about 32 molecules of ATP with about 7.3 cal/mol of free energy

# Concept 9.2 Glycolysis harvests chemical energy by oxidizing glucose to pyruvate

[[Glycolysis]] means sugar splitting
[[Glucose]] is split into two three-carbon sugars and then oxidized and become two molecules of [[Pyruvate]] 

[[Glycolysis]] has two phases, invest and release
Investment uses ATP

# Concept 9.3 After Pyruvate is oxidized, the citric acid cylce completes the energy yielding oxidation of organic molcules

Most energy remains in [[Pyruvate]] when O2 is present, the two pyruvate go to the mitocondrion
Oxidation of glucose happens

## Oxidation of Pyruvate to Acetyl CoA

[[Pyruvate]] converts into [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]]
Glycolysis to citric acid cycle is carried by multienzyme complex that does three reactions

![[Figure 9.8 The Steps of Glycolysis Energy Payoff Phase.png]]

The [[Pyruvate]]'s [[Carboxyl Groups]] is slightly oxidized as $\ce{ -COO^- }$  but gets fully oxidized into CO_2
The two remaining carbon fragments are oxidized into the electrons transfeered to NAD+ becoming NADH
[[Coenzyme A]] contains sulfer derived from B vitamin. The sulfur is attached to Two carbon intermediate to form [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]]
It contains high potential energy to transfer acetly group to a molecule in the citric acid cylce

## The Citric Acid Cycle

[[Citric Acid Cycle]] acts as metabolic furnace that oxidizes organic fuel from [[Pyruvate]]
[[Pyruvate]] is broken into three CO2 Molecules, which including the one release during conversion
The cylce forms 1 ATP per turn throuhg [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]]
Most energy is transferred to [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] and [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FAD]]
[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] and [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FAD]] shuttle high energy electonrs to [[Electron Transport Chains]]

[[Citric Acid Cycle]] has eight steps with a coordinated by specific [[Enzymes]]
Two carbons enter the the cycle in a reduced form of [[Acetyl Group]]
Two different carbons leave as CO_2 in steps 3 and 4

The [[Acetyl Group]] join the cycle by combining with [[Oxaloacetate]] to form [[Citrate]] in step 1
[[Citrate]] is the ionized form of [[Citric Acid]] 

The next 7 steps breaks down the [[Citrate]] back into [[Oxaloacetate]]

Energy rich molcules are produced
1 [[Acetyl Group]] : 3 NAD+ -> NADH
Electrons in step 6 are transferred to [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FAD]] which take two electrons and protons to become FADH2
Step 5 produces [[Guanosine Triphosphate]] through [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]]
[[Guanosine Triphosphate|GTP]] is like [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]
Step five forms an [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]

# Concept 9.4 During Oxidative Phosphorylation, Chemiosmosis couples electron transport to atp Synthesis

[[Glycolysis]] and [[Citric Acid Cycle]] produce 4 ATP per glucose molecule through [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]]

2 ATP from [[Glycosylation]] 
2 ATP from [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] and [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH2]] account for most energy extracted from each [[Glucose]] molecule

## The Pathway of Electron Transport

[[Electron Transport Chains]] are a collection of molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitchondrion

Folding of inner membrane form a [[Cristae]] and increase surface area
Most parts of the chain are proteins that exist in multiprotein complexes numbered I through IV
Connected to it are [[Prosthetic Groups]], nonprotein components such as [[Cofactors]] and [[Coenzymes]] 
During electron transport, carriers alternate between reduced and oxidized states

Each component gets reduced when its receives electrons upstream

### [[Respiratory Complex I]] 

Electrons acquired from [[Glucose]] by [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] during [[Glycosylation]] and [[Citric Acid Cycle]] are transferred from [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to the first molecule of [[Respiratory Complex I|Complex I]]

The molecule is a [[Flavoprotein]] because of the [[Prosthetic Groups|Prosthetic Group]] [[Flavin Mononucleotide]]

[[Flavoprotein]] oxidizes, losing electrons, by transferring them to an iron-sulfur protein [[Fe-S]]
Passes it to a compound [[Ubiquinone]]
	It is hydrophobic
	Only one that is not a type of [[Proteins]]
	It is individually mobile 
Electron carriers between [[Ubiquinone]] and oxygen are the proteins, [[Cytochromes]]
	Contains [[Prosthetic Groups]] called [[Heme Groups]]
		Contains iron atom that accepts or donates electrons
[[Electron Transport Chains]] contain multiple [[Cytochromes]]
The last one is [[cyt a3]] passes electrons to O_2 and picks up hydrogen to [[Dehydration Synthesis]] into water

[[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH2]] is a source for electrons but addes it within [[Respiratory Complex II]] with a lower energy level
Both [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] and [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH2]] donate the same amoutn ofv electrons 
FADH2 Produces less energy for ATP synthesis vs NADH

## Chemiosmosis: The Energy-Coupling Mechanism

[[ATP Synthase]] line the [[Mitochondria]] membrane and produces [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] from [[Adenosine Diphosphate|ADP]] and inorganic phosphate
[[ATP Synthase]] uses teh energy of an existing [[Ion Gradient]] to power ATP synthesis
Power soruce is a pH difference
Energy is stored as a hydrogen ion gradient and is called [[Chemiosmosis]]
[[ATP Synthase]] is a multisubunit complex with four main parts of polypeptides
protons move one by one into binding sites of the rotor
It is a molecular rotary motor 
H+ Gradient is a function of the electron transport chain
chain is an energy converter that uses exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2

Certain members of the chain transfer H+
Aqueous solution inside and surroudning cell are a source of H+

In eukaryotic cells teh electron carriers are spatially arranged in the inner mitochondrial membrane in such a way that H+ is accepted from the mitochondrial matrix and deposited into the intermembrane space this forms teh [[Proton-Motive Force]]

## An Accounting of ATP production by ceullar resipiration

Glucose -> NADH -> Electron Transport Chain -> Proton-motive force -> ATP

Thre parts that produce are glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and citric acid cycle, and electron transport chain

dirves oxidative phosphorylation

![[Figure 9.15 ATP Yield per molecule of glucose at each stage of cellular respiration.png]]

4 ATP during [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]] during glycolysis and citric acid cycle to many more molecules of atp generated by oxidative phosphorylation

Each NADH transfers a pair of electrons from glucose to the transport chain to give proton motive force power to make 3 atp

1 NADH -> 2.5 ATP
FADH_2 -> 1.5 ATP

ATP depeonds on shuttle used from cytosol into mitocondrion
electrons are shuttled through NAD+ or to FAD in the [[Mitochondrial Matrix]]
Fad in brain cells
NAD in liver and heart cells 

Oxidation of glucose  releases 686 kcal ($\ce{\Delta G = -686 \frac{kcal}{mol} }$)

## 9.5 Fermentation and Anaerobic Respiration enable cells to produce ATP without the use of Oxygen

ATP is mostly from [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]
[[Anaerobic Respiration]] and [[Fermentation]] are alternatives for situations without $O_{2}$
[[Electron Transport Chains]] is utilized in [[Anaerobic Respiration]] but not [[Fermentation]]
[[Sulfate]] is the end of [[Electron Transport Chains|Respiratory Chains]] in marine bacteria but byproduct is $H_{2}S$
[[Proton-Motive Force]]
Hydrogen sulfide is teh sorce of rotten egg oder in salt marsh or mudflat

[[Fermentation]] is a method of harvesting chemical energy without oxygen or chain (without cellular respiration)

[[Glycolysis]] oxidizes glucose two t molecules of [[Pyruvate]]
[[Oxidizing Agents]] for [[Glycolysis]] us [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]]
[[Glycosylation]] is exergonic and produce 2 net ATP through substrate level phosphorylation, the addition of $O_{2}$ adds 2 ATP

[[Fermentation]] is an extension of [[Glycolysis]] that allows continuous [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]]
It needs enough [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] to do so
[[Aerobic Cellular Respiration]] allows [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] to be recycled
[[Anaerobic Respiration]] transfers from [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to [[Glycolysis]]

## Types of Fermentation

[[Fermentation]] consists of [[Glycolysis]] and reactions that regenerate [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] by transferring electrons from [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to [[Pyruvate]]

[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] can oxidize sugar by glycolysis which nets two molecules of ATP via substrate level phosphorylation

Two forms are Alcohol fermentation and Lactic Acid Fermentation 

### [[Alcohol Fermentation]]

[[Pyruvate]] $\to$ [[Ethanol]] in two steps
Releases [[Carbon Dioxide]] from [[Pyruvate]] to form a two-carbon compound [[Acetaldehyde]]
[[Acetaldehyde]] is reduced by [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to [[Ethanol]]
It regenerates [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] from [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Reduction]] of [[Acetaldehyde]]
[[Bacteria]] can carry out [[Alcohol Fermentation]] under [[Anaerobic Respiration]] releasing [[Carbon Dioxide|CO2]]

![[Figure 9.16 Fermentation.png]]

## [[Lactic Acid Fermentation]]

[[Pyruvate]] is reduced directly by [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to form [[Lactate]] and regenerate [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] with no release of [[Carbon Dioxide|CO2]]
[[Red Muscle]] oxidizes [[Glucose]] to $CO_{2}$
[[White Muscle]] produces [[Lactate]] during [[Glycolysis]]
[[Lactate]] is [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidized]] by [[Red Muscle]]

Exercise can cause [[Carbohydrates]] [[Catabolism]] to out pace supply of $O_{2}$, lactate cannot be oxidzed to pyruvate
[[Lactate]] production improves performance during exercise
Excess lactate is shuttled to other tissues for oxidiation or to the liver and kidneys to produce glucose or glycogen

## Comparing Fermentation with Anaerobic and Aerobic Respiration

[[Fermentation]], [[Anaerobic Respiration]], and [[Aerobic Cellular Respiration]] are pathways to produce ATP
All three use [[Glycolysis]] to produce 2 ATP through [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]]
All three use [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] as [[Oxidizing Agents]]
Key difference is [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidizing]] [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] to [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]]
	[[Fermentation]] final acceptor is an organic molecule like [[Pyruvate]] or [[Acetaldehyde]]
	[[Cellular Respiration]] [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] transfers electrons to [[Electron Transport Chains]] to form [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]]
Production ATP is different per pathway
	[[Fermentation]] forms 2 ATP through [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]]
		Absence of electron transport chain is unavailable
	[[Cellular Respiration]]
		[[Pyruvate]] is completely oxidized in [[Mitochondria]]  
	[[Anaerobic Respiration]] can make 32 ATP, 16 more than fermntation

[[Obligate Anaerobes]] do not use [[Aerobic Cellular Respiration]], and cannot survice in oxygen
[[Facultative Anaerobes]] can go in two processes, classive pyruvate to acetly coa or lactic acid fermentation
	Sugar must be consumed faster

## The Evolutionary Significance of Glycolysis

Implies that organisms used glycolysis only

# Concept 9.6 Glycolysis and the Citric Acid Cycle connect to many other Metabolic Pathways

[[Glycolysis]] and [[Citric Acid Cycle]] is an intersection of [[Catabolism]] and [[Anabolism]]

## The Versatility of Catabolism

There are other forms of energy not from carbs
[[Glycolysis]] can accept a wide range of [[Carbohydrates]] for [[Catabolism]]
[[Starch]] is hydrolyzed into glucose
[[Glycogen]] the [[Polysaccharides]] stored by humans in liver and muscles can be [[Hydrolysis|Hydrolyzed]] to glucose between meals
[[Disaccharides]] can be broken down into [[Monosaccharides]] for fuel for [[Cellular Respiration]]
[[Proteins]] can be used but needs to be digested into [[Amino Acids]]
	Many amino acids are used to build new proteins
	Excess are turned into enzymes to intermediates of glycolysis and citric acid cylce
	[[Amino Group]] must be removed in [[Deamination]]
	[[Ammonia]] NH_3 is discarded in waste
[[Catabolism]] can harvest energy stroed in fats from food or fat cells
[[Fats|Triacylglycerols]] are broekn into [[Glycerol]] and [[Fatty Acids]]
Energy of fat is stored in the [[Fatty Acids]]
[[Beta Oxidation]] breaks down fatty acids down to two carbon fragments that goes into TCA as [[Acetyl Coenzyme A]]
[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] and [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH2]] is geneerated during [[Beta Oxidation]]
[[Hydrocarbons]] are great fuels

## Biosynthesis (Anabolic Pathways)

Food must provide [[Carbon Skeletons]] to make molecules
[[Amino Acids]] can from food can be used in own proteins
[[Compounds]] [[Intermediate Products]] from [[Glycolysis]] can be used into [[Anabolic Pathways]]
Humans can make 10 amino acids, but the other 10 has to be eaten
[[Fatty Acids]] can be synthesized from [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]]

## Regulation of Cellular Respiration via Feedback Mechanisms

Surplus material causes some stages to be disabled through [[Feedback Inhibition]]
[[Products]] of anabolic pathways inhibit the [[Enzymes]] that [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] an early step of teh pathway
[[Cells]] control its own [[Catabolism]], depeneding on level of ATP
[[Phosphofructokinase]] can be considered a pacemaker of [[Cellular Respiration]]
	It is an [[Allosteric Regulation|Allosteric]] enyzme with receptor sites for inhibitors and activators
	Inbhibited by [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] and stimulated by [[Adenosine Monophosphate|AMP]]
	It is sensitive to [[Citrate]] and it can inhibit [[Phosphofructokinase]] 

# Chapter 9 Review
