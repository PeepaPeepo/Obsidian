[[Start Codon|AUG Codon]] is a universal start codon and refers to the [[Translation|Translate]] in the [[Central Dogma of Molecular Biology]]. For each codon, an amino acid is associated with it. AUG typically is [[Methionine]], but only in [[Eukarya]]. 

Within [[Bacteria]], [[Prokaryotes]], the amino acid associated with the AUG Codon is [[N-formylmethionine]], an alternate form of methionine.
