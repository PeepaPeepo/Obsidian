The [[Citric Acid Cycle]] further [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidize]] [[Products]] from [[Glycolysis]] and generates the following products: 2 [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]], 2 [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH_2]], 6 [[Carbon Dioxide|CO_2]], and 8 [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]].

The Krebs cycle occurs in the [[Mitochondrial Matrix]].
# Inputs and Outputs

## Inputs

2 [[Pyruvate]] $\ce{ -> }$ 2 [[Acetyl Coenzyme A]]
2 [[Oxaloacetate]]

## Outputs

2 [[Adenosine Triphosphate]]
8 [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]]
2 [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH_2]]
6 [[Carbon Dioxide]]

For each turn of the cycle, two carbons enter in the reduced form of [[Acetyl Group]]

1. Two carbons come from reduced from of [[Acetyl Group]]

3/4. Two different carbons leave oxidized forms of CO_2

[[Acetyl Group]] of [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]] combines with [[Oxaloacetate]] and forms [[Citrate]], an ionized form Citric Acid

Then it decomposes it into oxaloacetate

# Stages of Citric Acid Cycle

## Stage 1

$$\ce{ Oxaloacetate ->[Acetyl CoA->Coa-SH] Citrate }$$

[[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]] drops off the [[Acetyl Group]] of itself to [[Oxaloacetate]] to form a [[Citrate]], the [[Coenzyme A]] is recycled to do work somewhere else.

## Stage 2

$$\ce{ Citrate ->[->H_{2}O->][Acontinatse] Isocitrate }$$
[[Citrate]] is rearranged into [[Isocitrate]] through [[Acontinase]] and the removal and addition of $H_{2}O$

# Stage 3

$$\ce{ Isocitrate ->[NAD+ -> NADH + CO_{2}][Isocitrate Dehydrogenase] \alpha-Ketoglutarate }$$

[[Isocitrate Dehydrogenase]] catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of [[Isocitrate]] and forms [[Alpha-Ketoglutarate]]

# Stage 4

$$\ce{ \alpha-Ketoglutarate ->[NAD+ ->NADH + CO_{2}][\alpha-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase] Succinyl CoA  }$$
Another $CO_{2}$ and NADH is released

## Stage 5
