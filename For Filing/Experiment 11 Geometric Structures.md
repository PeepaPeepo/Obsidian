# Geometrical Structures of Molecules

# Objective

Practice drawing Lewis structures of molecules, determine the molecular geometry and polarity 

# Writing Lews Structure for Covalent Compounds

1. Draw correct skeletal structure for molecule

Central atoms are the least electronegative element
and is typically listed first in formula
Hydrogen Atoms will always be terminal
Many molecules tend to be symmetrical

Lewis theory has many flaws in advanced [[Molecules]]

2. Calculate the total number of electrons for the lewis structure by summing the valence electrons of each atoms

Number of valence electrons for any main group is equal to its group number
When writing for a polyatomic ion the charge of the ion must be considered when 
Calculating the total number electrons

Distribute the electrons among the atoms, giving octets or duets for hydrogen to as many atoms as possible

3. Begin by placing two electrons between each pair of atoms, these are the minimal number of bodning electrons
Then distribute the remaining electrons, first to terminal then to the centra, giving octets

4. If any atoms lack an octet, form a double or triple bonds to give them octets 

$\ce{ NF_{3} }$

N is the central atom

```
F N F
  F
```

Summing all the valence electrons for each atom 

N has 5
F has $\ce{ 7*3 }$ 
26 valence electrons

# Determine Shape

Look at Central Atom and look at [[Electron Groups]]
Consists of Bonds and Lone Pairs, Free Radical,
N will have 4

# Electron and Molecular Geometries

Categories pre-dominantly by [[Electron Groups]]

# Predicint Geometry using VSEPER THeory

[[VSEPR Theory]]

Draw correct lewis structure
determine total number of electron groups
Determine the number of bonding groups and lone pairs
Determine the electron
