![[Maltose Structural Formula.png]]

[[Maltose]] is a [[Disaccharides|Disaccharide]] made of two [[Glucose]] [[Monomers]] that form alpha [[Glycosidic Linkages]] between their 1' and 4' carbons. They must be linked in a way to leave one [[Anomeric Carbons]] open to form an [[Aldehydes]] [[Carbonyl Groups]]. The hydroxyl group of the second glucose's anomeric carbon can either be in $\alpha$ or $\beta$ position, meaning it's positioned below or above the carbon skeleton ring.
