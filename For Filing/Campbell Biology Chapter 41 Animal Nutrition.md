# Digestive System

Secretion that promote digestion

# Concept 41.3 Organs specialized for sequential stages of food processes

[[Amylase]] from [[Saliva]]
Eventual breakdown into [[Monosaccharides]]
absorption into small intestines
[[Pepsin]]
Lipid droplets

## The oral cavity, Pharynx, and And esopague

[[Oral Cavity]] food processing
[[Salivary Glands]]
[[Mucus]]
Tongue shaping a bolus shape
[[Pharynx]]
[[Esophagus]] connects to the stomach
[[Trachea]] leads to the lungs
Swallowing causes [[Epiglottis]] to prevent 
[[Esophagus]] food is pushed along from the [[Pharynx]] to the stomach by [[Peristasis]]
Alternating waves of smooth muscle contraction and relaxtion
[[Sphincters]] regulate movement of material between compartments

## Digestion in the stomach

[[Stomach]] stores food and processes into a liquid suspension
[[Gastric Juice]] secretion
Low pH of about 2 which kills bacteria and denaturing proteines
HCl and [[Pepsin]]
Pepsin is a type of [[Proteases]] that break down peptide bonds to process into polypeptides
[[Parietal Cells]] secrete hydrogene and chloride ions in teh lume n of the stomach
CHief cells secrete inactive 
Stomach contains pits
[[Chief Cells]] excretes [[Pepsinogen]]
[[Parietal Cells]] excrete H and Cl ions
	Disrupts ECM
	Denatures Proteins
	Converts pepsinogen to pepsin
[[Positive Feedback]] catalyzes further reactions 
[[Mucus Cells]] line pits
[[Gastric Glands]]
[[Sphincters]] control in and outputs of stomach

## Stomach Dynamics

Churning of stomach
[[Small Intestine]] is hte longest compartment of the alimentary canal
	Most enzymatic hydrolysis of macromolecules from food occurs here
Different processes per [[Macromolecules]]
First portion of small intestine is [[Duodenum]]
Chyme from stomach mixes with digestive juices from pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and teh small intestine itself
[[Pancreas]] 
Bile salts facilitate digestion of fats and major component of [[Bile]]
Bile is made in the [[Liver]] and stored and concentrated in
Digestion largely completed in the duodenum
Smalll intestine has Villi and Microvilli that are exposed to the intestial lumen
Enormous microvillar surface

## Absorption in the Small Intestine

[[Passive Transport]]
[[Active Transport]]

## Liver

[[Hepatic Portal Vein]] carries nutrient rich blood from the capillaries
Epithlial cells absorb fatty acids and a monoglyceride and recombine them into triglycerides
Fats are coded with Phospholipids, chloestoerosl, and proteins to from chylo

## Processing in the large intestine

[[Alimentary Canal]] ends with [[Large Intestine]]
Colon, Caecum, and Rectum
[[Colon]] leads to the [[Rectum]] and [[Anus]]
[[Cecum]] adids in the fermentation of plant material and connect where the small and large intestine
[[Appendix]]
Completes the recovery of water that began in the small intestine
[[Feces]] is the wastes of the digestive system, become more solid as they move through the colon
Community of bacteria living on unap
