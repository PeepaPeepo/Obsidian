# Perform this calculation to the correct number of significant figures: 78.222 × (12.02 − 11.52) 
60.23

# What is the edge length of a 155-g iron cube? (The density of iron is 7.86 g/cm3, and the volume of a cube is equal to the edge length cubed.) 



# A $125 Million Unit Error

- December 11, 1998
- NASA launched Mars Climate Orbiter
- Used as communication relay for Mars Polar Lander
- Orbiter was too low in altitude
- Came within 57 km of planetary surface
- Computers were made in Metric
- Ground engineers calculated in English Imperial Units

# Writing Large and Small Numbers

## Express very large and very small numbers using scientific notation

- Scientific notation is used to compress numbers due to the new ability to quantize high value digits
- Consists of decimal part, and exponential part

$1.2*10^{-10}$

- Positive exponents mean base number is multiplied
- Negative exponents are divided
- Move decimal point to left or right to get a value between $1<x<10$
- Then multiply by $10^{n}$ to compensate for the previous move 
- ***Must retain original significant figures unless instructed to***
- It prevents any confusion in the future

## SKILLBUILDER 2.1 **| Scientific Notation**

### The total U.S. national debt in 2016 was approximately $18,416,000,000,000. Express this number in scientific notation.

$1.8416*10^{{13}}$

### The radius of a carbon atom is approximately 0.000000000070 m. Express this number in scientific notation.

$0.000000000070 m = 7.0*10^{-11} m$ 
 
# 2.3 Scientific Figures: Writing Numbers to Reflect Precision

## Report Measured quantities to the right number of digits. Determine which digits in a number are significant.

- Climate change is popular issue, average change is $0.7^o \ C$ 
- **Scientific numbers are certain except for the last**
- First four digits are certain, the last digit is estimated
- Greater the precision have proportionately more figures
- 45.872
- 2 is estimated
- The last number of a value should be a uncertain number

## Counting Significant Figures

1. All non-zero digits are significant
2. Interior numbers are significant
3. Trailing zeroes are right of a fall after a decimal point is significant 1.0 
4. Trailing zero that falls before a decimal point are significant 
	1. 20.2 
5. Leading zeroes before non-zero is insignificant
6. Trailing zeros at the end are ambiguous and avoided with scientific notation
	1. 2400 is ambiguous
	2. $2.4*10^{3}$
[[Significant Figures]]


# Rules for Rounding

- Results are rounded to reflect sig figs of data
- Calculations involving multiple steps should not be rounded until fully calculated
- Use only the last digit being dropped to round
	- $14.802$ for 3 sig figs, ignore 2 onwards
- Round down if last digit is =<4
- Round up if last digit is =>5

# 2.4 Significant Figures in Calculations

## Multiplication and Division Rule 

The result of multiplication or division carries the same number of sig figs as the factor with the fewest sig figs

# Addition and Subtraction

Results maintains the same number of decimal places as the quantity with the least about of decimal places

# Both Multiplication/Division and Addition/Subtraction

1. Express parenthesis
2. Determine correct number of sig figs without rounding ****
3. Complete calculation
4. Round accordingly

$3+ (15/12)$
$(3+15)/12$ 

1.25 + 3

1.5

Mark sig figures throughout multistep equations
Keep lowest significant figure of the earliest low sig fig

Review How Many $cm^3$ in $2.5m^3$

- Common systems
	- English/Imperial
	- Metric System
- Metric system is called [[International System]] or [[SI Units]]
	- SI comes from French Système International

# 2.5 The Basic Units of Measurement

## The Base units

- Meter (m)
- Kilogram (kg)
- second (s)
- temperature (K)

## The base unit of length

- established 1983, the distance that light travel in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 s

## The base unit of mass

- kilogram 20 is kept at National Institute of Standards and Technology near Washing, D.C.
- Quantity of matter within 
- Weight depends on gravity
- 
## The base unit of time

- Using an atomic clock
- duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted from a certain transition in cesium-133 atom

# Derived Units

- Volume
- Any unit of length cubed becomes volume
- m^3 is a cubic meter
- liter and ml is not a derived unit
- 1 gallon is equal to 3.785 L
- mililiter is the same as 1 cm^3

# 2.6 Problem Solving and Unit Conversion

- Unit conversion problems

## Converting Between Units

- Always write numbers with its unit
- Always include units in calculations and treat it like algebraic quantities

## General Problem-Solving Strategy

- Identify Starting point
- Identify end point
- Use solution map

## Common Unit conversion

### Length

1 km = 0.6214 mi
1m = 39.37 in
1ft = 30.48 cm 
1 in = 2.54 cm

### Mass
- 1kg
- 1lb
- 1oz

## volume

- 1 l
- 1l
- 1

liters for liquids
cm^3 for solids

m=dv for solids and liquids

Convert to closest conversion relationship

2.5in - cm - m

Rule of thumb is to cross cancel conversion units

- When converting quantities with units raised to a power, such as cubic centimeters $cm^3$, you must raise the conversion factor to that power
- $1255cm^3$ to cubic inches
- $2.54cm=1in.$
- Cube both sides to obtain proper conversion factor
- $2.54^{3}=1in^3$
- A power to a power multiplies the exponents ONLY if the bases are the same








When converting quantities with units raised to a power, the conversion factor must always be raised to that power
