[[Pyranose Carbons]] are 6 membered [[Carbohydrates|Saccharide]] rings regardless of the number of carbons it contains as opposed to [[Hexoses]], which are 6 carbon [[Carbohydrates|Saccharides]]. 

[[Hemiacetal]] forms when one of the [[Hydroxyl Groups]] reaches back to bond to the [[Electrophiles]] Carbonyl carbon.

Pyranose and Furanose carbons are very versatile because of presence of both [[Hydroxyl Groups]] and [[Carbonyl Groups]].
