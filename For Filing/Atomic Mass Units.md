- [[Atomic Masses]] of an [[Elements|Element]] is the average weight of all of its [[Isotopes]] in [[daltons]]
- Atomic mass unit of an element is equal the grams of an element in 1 mol
- amu is equal to a [[daltons|dalton]] which is 1/12 mass of one atom of $\ce{ ^12C }$ 
# Example

$\ce{ 1 mol C = 12.01 g C }$


# Calculating AMU of an Element

$$\ce{ amu = m_{1}p_{1} + m_{2}p_{2} + so on so fourth }$$

Finding an abundance is setting one of the unknown percentages = $\ce{ 1 - given \% }$.
