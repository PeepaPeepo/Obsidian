[[Proteins]] are [[Macromolecules]] made up of [[Polypeptides]], which are composed of [[Amino Acids]] that form unbranched [[Peptide Bonds]] between them. Proteins can be categorized as the following based on their functions: 

- [[Enzymatic Proteins|Enzymatic Proteins]]
	- [[Amylase]]
- [[Defensive Proteins]]
- [[Storage Proteins]]
- [[Transport Proteins]]
- [[Hormonal Proteins]]
- [[Receptor Proteins]]
- [[Contractile and Motor Proteins]]
- [[Structural Proteins]]
- [[Glycoproteins]]
	- [[Calagen]]

[[Polypeptides]] composition determines the [[Primary Structures]], [[Secondary Structures]], [[Tertiary Structures]], and [[Quaternary Structures]] of [[Proteins]]. Composition affects shape and function of a Protein [[Macromolecules]], and any changes can change its identity and shape. 

The structure of proteins can be broken and the process is called [[Denaturation]]. The interactions of structures can be broken through heat or chemical reactions. 

- Greek for Proteios
- More than 50% dry mass of most cells
- Proteins can speed up [[Chemical Reactions]]
- Most structurally Complex [[Molecules]] known
- Have unique three dimensional shapes
- Made up of same set of the 20 [[Amino Acids]]
- Biological functional molecule made up of multiple [[Polypeptides]] that fold and coil into specific structures
