## Bonding Theories

[[Bonding Theories]] predict formation of atoms in compounds
Predicts why water is $\ce{ H_{2}O }$
Explains the shapes and how it determines [[Chemical Properties]]
Using [[Bonding Theories]] can help draw an accurate 
Form equals function in this case
$\ce{ H_{2}O }$ forms a V formation

## Lewis Theory

[[Lewis Theory]] after [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] 
[[Lewis Structures]] can determine if [[Atoms]] can form a stable [[Molecules]]
Simplest method for quick everyday predictions about [[Molecules]]

## Representing Valence Electrons with Dots

Valence electrons of main group elements are surrounded by dots around the symbol
Valence electrons are equal to main [[Element Groups]] of [[Main Group Elements]]

Distribute Dots based on [[Electron Configurations]]
Arrangement leans towards symmetry

[[Octet Rule]]

[[Ionic Bonds]] transfers [[Electrons]] from [[Metals]] to [[Nonmetals]]

## Writing Lewis Structures for Covalent Compounds

Molecules tend to be symmetrical, but their have many exceptions. 
Add the [[Valence Electrons]]
[[Polyatomic Ions]] should be considered in calculating the total number of electrons
Distribute electrons among atoms with the goal of making octets 
begin with placing two electrons between each pair of atoms
Then distribute the remaining electrons 

If any atoms lacj an octet, form double or triple bonds as necessary to give them octets

[[Central Atoms]]

$\ce{ O = C = O }$
