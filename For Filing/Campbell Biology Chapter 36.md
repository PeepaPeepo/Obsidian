# Concept 36.3 People modify crops by breeding and genetic engineering

Domestication of crops occured over a short period about 10,000 years ago
Maize has bee nartifically selected to have kernals mermanelty attached to the cob
Could not survive in the wild 

## Plant Breeding

Plant breeders search the world for wild or domesticated plants
[[Transgene]] a geen transfered from one organism to another, can also occur in nature
Ancestor of modern sweet potat received a horizontal gene from soil bacterium

## Plant biotechnology and genetic engineering

Refers to innovatin in the use of plants
GMO in agriculture and industry

[[Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9 System|CRISPR-Cas9 System]] 
[[Genetically Modified Organisms]] GMO in agriculture and industry
No chemicals associataed with GMO 

"New organisms" that come with new allergy developement
Needed to produce high yield food
These GMO compete with naturally occurring species
Reduces genetic diversity

[[Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9 System|CRISPR-Cas9 System]] can modify plants

## Reducing world hunger and malnutrition

Global hunger affects nearly a billion people, food productiong needs to increase by 40% per hectare

Biotechnology can help address this problem by increasing crop yields and teh quality of food without expanding agricultureal lands

## Reducing ofssil fuel dependency

[[Biofuels]] derived from livign biomass, such as swtich grass and poplar
Biofuels could meet much 

## Possible effects on nontarget organisms

GM crops may have unforseen effects non target organsims
Spraying chemicals on nongmo plants can affect wildlfie

## Addressing the problem of transgene escape

Male sterlitly 
[[Apomixis]] the aesexual formation of a seed from the maternal tissue of the ovule
Transgenes into chloroplasts dna
genetic mod

## WHat are some factors that plants sense

Sunflowers track the sun
can produce hormolnes
Temperature
Gravity
Damage from heribvores
Can detect time

# Concept 39.2 plants use chemicals to communicate

PLants can transport macromolecules using [[Plasmodesmata]]

## General characteristics of plant hormones

[[Hormones]] are signaling molecules that is produced in low concentrations in one part of the body and transported to other parts

Plant growth regulators, control multiple processes

## A survey of horomones

[[Auxin]] controls [[Phototropism]]
[[Cytokinins]]
[[Gibberellins]]
[[Abscisic Acids]]
