Chemical Principle Teaching Ideas  
Matter  
Try to have the students come up with something that is NOT matter, and they will  
quickly realize that everything around them is matter.  
Classification of Matter  
A good exercise in classifying matter into certain categories is to point around the room,  
asking students what each object is and what group it falls under. There are plenty of examples  
of each grouping in a classroom; even the human body has some of each category.  
Properties and Changes of Matter  
Try listing various changes and ask the students if the changes are physical or chemical.  
List some measurable properties and ask students to classify them as physical or chemical changes.  
Conservation of Mass  
Some students will say that this is not true, as in a nuclear reaction where mass is  
converted into energy. Explain to them that this law is for chemical reactions, where no nuclear  
changes take place.  
Energy  
The total energy in the universe is constant, but the universe is expanding at a furious  
pace. You can use this opportunity to talk about the universe, how it was born, and its history.  
Temperature  
To help students understand why we have different temperature scales, you can discuss  
the origin of each scale. The Fahrenheit scale is based on the average temperature of the  
human body being at 100 °F (it was off a little bit) and the freezing point of a salt-ice bath of  
0 °F. The Celsius scale is based on the freezing point and boiling point of pure water as 0° and  
100° Celsius, respectively. The Kelvin scale is based on the coldest temperature that is possible,  
the temperature at which molecular motion ceases, and is set as 0 K.  
Heat Capacity  
One easy way for students to remember the concept of heat capacity and its relative  
magnitude is for them to look at water heating on a stove. Most of them will agree that if you put  
an empty metal pot on a stove the pot will get hot very quickly. However, if we fill the pot with  
water, it will take a very long time for the water to get to the same temperature. If they remember  
this scenario, they should remember that metals have a low heat capacity and water has quite a  
high heat capacity.

## 3.12 Energy and Heat Capacity Calculations  

Learning Objective: Perform calculations involving transfer of heat and changes in  
temperature.  
A. Heat = mass × heat capacity × temperature change  
B. Heat capacity is a conversion factor between temperature change, heat, and mass

The Atomic Theory  
Many students believe that we have completely understood current atomic theory for  
centuries. They do not understand that the concepts we now hold as truth became “mainstream”  
only 200 years ago, with many changes occurring since. Providing a brief history of atomic  
theory, starting with Plato and Aristotle’s belief that the four elements—air, water, earth, and  
fire—were the ingredients of all matter gives students a historical perspective.  
Discovery of the Atom’s Nucleus  
Demonstrations of the rudimentary experiments that revolutionized atomic theory will go  
a long way toward making students understand that chemistry is an experimental science and that  
most of what we learn was discovered through pure experimentation.  
Charge  
Most students understand the concept of electrical charge, but a simple demonstration of  
static electricity will reinforce the idea.  
The Periodic Table  
The periodic table can be the best exam “cheat sheet” a student could ever use. By  
understanding the layout of the table, many trends and quite a lot of information can be  
extracted. Mentioning briefly the things that have periodic trends will also reinforce the periodic  
law in their minds.  
Atomic Number, Ions, and Isotopes  
Emphasize that all atoms having the same number of protons behave the same chemically  
and only differ in their mass, and then only if they are different isotopes. A real world example is  
a pile of paper clips of various shapes, sizes, and colors. They differ in observable properties, but  
all behave the same when they “react” as they all hold paper. A similar example can be made  
with cork stoppers of different sizes.  

## Guided Inquiry Ideas  
Below are a few example questions that students answer in the guided inquiry activities provided  
in the Guided Activity Workbook.  
If an atom has a net charge of zero, what could you conclude about the relative number of  
electrons and protons? Explain.  
Rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that practically all the mass is concentrated in a very  
small location called the nucleus. Which particles must be in the nucleus?  
A mad scientist proposes that Type 2 carbon has more protons. How would you respond?  
How many electrons would you need to weigh the same as one proton?  
Describe the relationship between the name of an element and its symbol.

Chemical Principle Teaching Ideas  
Compounds  
To illustrate the universal makeup of a compound, show examples of different forms of  
the same molecule. Showing a sample of solid, liquid, and gaseous water and explaining that the  
ratio of hydrogen atoms to oxygen atoms is the same will help teach the concept.  
Chemical Formulas  
Emphasize that all molecules are composed of atoms in small, whole-number ratios.

students one easy example of each to memorize, and tell them that if they remember one  
example of each, they can derive the rules. Suggested molecules are CO2, NaCl, and FeCl 2.  
Formula Mass  
Doing several examples of formula mass of molecules is the best way for students to  
become comfortable with this concept. Be sure to include at least one case of multiple  
polyatomic ions; for example, (NH4)2SO4.  
Skill Builder Solutions  
5.1. 4.3 g O 7.5 g O  
1.3, and 1.3  
3.2 g C 5.6 g C  
= = Yes, these data are consistent with the law of  
constant composition.  
5.2. a. Ag 2S shows 2 silvers to every 1 sulfur.  
b. N2O shows 2 nitrogen atoms to every oxygen.  
c. TiO2 shows 2 oxygen atoms to every 1 titanium.  
5.3 The subscript 2 on K means there are 2 potassium atoms. No subscript on the S implies  
1 sulfur, and the subscript 4 behind the O represents 4 oxygen atoms.

Copyright © 2018 Pearson Education, Inc. Page 20  
Plus. The subscript 2 behind the Al indicates 2 aluminum atoms for each molecule. There are  
3 sulfate groups, each having 1 sulfur and 4 oxygen atoms; therefore, there are 3 sulfur  

atoms and 3 × 4 = 12 oxygen atoms in Al 2(SO4) 3.  
5.4. a. Molecular element; chlorine is one of the seven species that exist as diatomic species.  
b. Molecular compound; this species contains two different nonmetals, so it is a  
compound.  
c. Atomic element; gold is a monatomic element.  
d. Ionic compound; a metal and a nonmetal form an ionic species.  
e. Ionic compound; a metal and a nonmetal form an ionic species.  
5.5. Since the strontium cation has a +2 charge and chlorine anion has a −1 charge, we need  
2 chlorine atoms for each strontium atom. Thus, the formula is SrCl 2.  
5.6. The aluminum cation has a +3 charge and nitrogen anion has a −3 charge, so we need  
only one of each to make a neutral species: AlN.  
5.7 The aluminum cation has a +3 charge and the phosphate anion has a −3 charge, so we  
need only one of each to make a neutral species: AlPO4.  
Plus. The sodium cation has a +1 charge and the sulfite anion has a −2 charge, so we need  
2 sodium cations for every 1 sulfite anion to make a neutral species: Na2SO3.  
5.8. The cation is potassium and the anion is bromine, which becomes bromide, so the  
correct name is potassium bromide.  
Plus. The cation is zinc, and the anion is nitrogen, which becomes nitride, giving the correct  
name zinc nitride.  
5.9. Since the oxygen has a −2 charge and there is just 1 lead atom, it must be in a +2 state.  
Therefore, the name is lead (II) oxide.  
5.10. The nitrate oxyanion has a charge of −1, and there are two of them for a total charge  
of −2. Since there is only one manganese, it must have a +2 charge, giving a  
name of manganese (II) nitrate.  
5.11. Two nitrogen atoms get a prefix of di, and 4 oxygen atoms get a prefix of tetra for the  
name dinitrogen tetroxide.  
5.12. The base name of fluorine is fluor, so HF is called hydrofluoric acid.  
5.13. Since NO2 (nitrite) ends in -ite, the acid name ends in -ous giving nitrous acid.  
5.14. 2 × the mass of nitrogen + 1 × the mass of oxygen = 2(14.01 amu) + 1(16.00 amu) =  
44.02 amu.

understand how a mole is just a number, nothing else.  
Chemical Formulas and Chemical Composition  
Explain that when we are talking about making large things, such as cars, bicycles, and  
houses, we are concerned not with the mass of each component, but with the actual number of  
each reactant. In the chemistry lab, we cannot count the actual number of atoms in a beaker, but  
we can measure the mass of the reactants. With the molar mass, we can then easily convert  
between the mass and the number of molecules (moles).  
Empirical and Molecular Formulas from Laboratory Data  
Any time you can reinforce a concept with a simple demonstration, it will help the  
students with the material. Here is a valuable opportunity to show them exactly how it can be  
done in the laboratory.

Chemical Principle Teaching Ideas  
Chemical Equations  
Start with a very simple example, such as 2 wheels + 1 bike → 1 bicycle. Emphasize that  
each species should have a coefficient in front of it, letting the reader know that the equations  
represent nothing more than a recipe. It says nothing about the actual number of species in the  
system. Remind students that you can multiply all the coefficients by the same value and the  
equation will still be balanced.  
Aqueous Solutions and Solubility  
All solutions that a student encounters have dissolved solids, even tap water, soda, and  
fruit juice. Use these and other common examples to help students understand the solubility of  
various species.

Types of Reactions and How to Classify Them  
There are many examples of each kind of reaction either that the students are familiar  
with or that can be done safely in the lecture room. Showing students an example of each to  
memorize will help them when they are trying to classify new reactions. Make sure to mention  
that a chemical reaction can be of more than one type.  
Skill Builder Solutions  
7.1. a. During combustion, butane turns into carbon dioxide and water, giving off  
heat and light. Since the identity of the substances is changing, it is a chemical  
reaction.  
b. During evaporation, butane exhibits a phase change, from liquid to gas, so it is not a  
chemical reaction.  
c. The combustion of wood involves long organic molecules combining with oxygen to  
yield water and carbon dioxide. The substances are changing identity, so it is a  
chemical reaction.  
d. Sublimation is only a phase change and does not involve the rearrangement  
of atoms; therefore, it is not a chemical reaction.  
7.2. Cr 2O3(s) + C(s) → Cr(s) + CO2(g)  
Balance the chromium atoms first, so we need a 1 in front of the Cr 2O3(s) and a 2  
in front of the Cr(s):  
Cr 2O3(s) + C(s) → 2 Cr(s) + CO2(g)  
There are 3 oxygen atoms on the left, so we need a 3/2 in front of the CO2 (g):  
Cr 2O3(s) + C(s) → 2 Cr(s) + 3/2 CO2(g)  
There are 3/2 carbons on the right, so we need a 3/2 in front of C(s):  
Cr 2O3(s) + 3/2 C(s) → 2 Cr(s) + 3/2 CO2(g)  
To clear the fractions, multiply everything by 2:  
2 Cr 2O3(s) + 3 C(s) → 4 Cr(s) + 3 CO2(g)  
7.3. C4H10(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(g)  
Balance the carbon atoms first by putting a 1 in front of C 4H10 and a 4 in front of CO2:  
C4H10(g) + O2(g) → 4 CO2(g) + H2 O(g)  
There are 10 hydrogen atoms on the left, so we need 5 H2O molecules on the right:  
C4H10(g) + O2(g) → 4 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(g)  
There are 13 oxygen atoms on the right, so to balance the equation, we need a  
13/2 in front of O2(g):  
C4H10(g) + 13/2 O2(g) → 4 CO2(g) + 5 H2O(g)  
To remove the fractional coefficients, multiply everything by 2:  
2 C4H10(g) + 13 O2(g) → 8 CO2(g) + 10 H2O(g)  
7.4. Skeletal equation found by switching partners and making neutral products:  
Pb(C2H3 O2) 2 (aq) + KI(aq) → PbI 2(s) + KC2H 3O2(aq)  
Pb is balanced as it now appears.  
Pb(C2H3 O2) 2 (aq) + KI(aq) → PbI 2(s) + KC2H 3O2(aq)

Copyright © 2018 Pearson Education, Inc. Page 29  
There are 2 acetate ions “fixed” on the left side, so we will balance those next by  
adding a 2 in front of the potassium acetate:  
Pb(C2H3 O2) 2 (aq) + KI(aq) → PbI 2(s) + 2 KC2H 3O 2(aq)  
There are 2 iodine atoms on the right, so we need two on the left for the balanced  
reaction:  
Pb(C2H3 O2) 2 (aq) + 2 KI(aq) → PbI 2(s) + 2 KC2H 3O2(aq)  
7.5. HCl(g) + O2(g) → H2O(l) + Cl 2(g)  
Cl only appears in one species on each side, so we will balance that first. There are two  
on the right hand side and one on the left, so we need to add a 2 to the HCl:  
2 HCl(g) + O2(g) → H2 O(l) + Cl 2(g)  
There is 1oxygen on the right, so we need a 1/2 in front of O 2 on the left:  
2 HCl(g) + 1/2 O 2(g) → H2O(l) + Cl 2(g)  
Remove the fraction by multiplying everything by 2:  
4 HCl(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l) + 2 Cl 2(g)  
7.6. a. Insoluble; most sulfides are insoluble, and Cu salts are not an exception (Table 7.2).  
b. Soluble; iron (II) sulfate is soluble because sulfates are soluble, and iron is not an  
exception.  
c. Insoluble; lead(II) carbonate is insoluble, as are most lead salts.  
d. Soluble; ammonium chloride is soluble, as are all other ammonium salts.  
7.7. The two potential products are Ni(OH) 2 and KBr. KBr is soluble, but Ni(OH) 2 is not,  
giving- NiBr 2(aq) + KOH(aq) → Ni(OH) 2(s) + KBr(aq), which, when balanced, yield  
NiBr 2(aq) + 2 KOH(aq) → Ni(OH) 2(s) + 2 KBr(aq).  
7.8. The two potential products are NH4NO3 and FeCl 3, both of which are soluble, so no  
precipitation occurs.  
7.9. Potassium sulfate: K2SO4 ; Strontium nitrate: Sr(NO3) 2. Potential products are KNO3 and  
SrSO4. The SrSO4 is an insoluble product (exception to sulfate rule), so the  
reaction is  
K2SO 4(aq) + Sr(NO3) 2(aq) → KNO3 (aq) + SrSO4(s).  
Balancing gives  
K2SO 4(aq) + Sr(NO3) 2(aq) → 2 KNO3(aq) + SrSO4(s).  
7.10. We must first break up all the aqueous species, giving the overall ionic equation  
2 H+(aq) + 2 Br−(aq) + Ca 2+ (aq) + 2 OH−(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + Ca 2+ (aq) + 2 Br−(aq).  
In this reaction, bromine and calcium are spectators, so the net ionic equation is  
2 H+(aq) + 2 OH−(aq) → 2 H2O(l).  
Now divide all coefficients by 2 to get the final balanced net ionic equation.  
H+(aq) + OH−(aq) → H2O(l).  
7.11. This is a reaction between an acid and a base, so the products are a salt and water. The  
initial reaction is thus  
H2SO 4(aq) + 2 KOH(aq) → 2 H2 O(l) + K2SO4(aq).

Copyright © 2018 Pearson Education, Inc. Page 30  
We break up all aqueous species to get the overall ionic equation:  
2 H+(aq) + SO42−(aq) + 2 K+(aq) + 2 OH−(aq) → 2 H2O(l) + 2 K+(aq) + SO42− (aq)  
Removing the spectator ions K+ and SO42−, we get  
2 H+(aq) + 2 OH−(aq) → 2 H2O(l).  
Now divide all coefficients by 2 to get the final balanced net ionic equation.  
H+(aq) + OH−(aq) → H2O(l).  
7.12. By simply switching partners, we get the following reaction:  
2 HBr(aq) + K2SO 3(aq) → H2SO3(aq) + 2 KBr(aq).  
The H2SO 3(aq) will decompose into H2O(l) and SO2(g), giving  
2 HBr(aq) + K2SO 3(aq) → H2O(l) + SO2(g) + 2 KBr(aq).  
Plus. We must first write the complete ionic equation:  
2 H+(aq) + 2 Br−(aq) + 2 K+ (aq) + SO32−(aq) → H2O(l) + SO2(g) + 2 K+(aq) + 2 Br−(aq).  
Removing the spectator ions, we have the following for the net ionic equation:  
2 H+(aq) + SO32−(aq) → H2O(l) + SO2(g).  
7.13. a. Lithium goes from an oxidation state of 0 to +1, losing 1 electron, while chlorine goes  
from an oxidation state of 0 to −1, gaining an electron, so it is a redox reaction.  
b. The oxidation state of Al goes from 0 to +3, losing 3 electrons, while each Sn 2+ gains 2  
electrons, so it is a redox reaction.  
c. This is a precipitation reaction, and the oxidation states of all species remain constant.  
Thus, it is not a redox reaction.  
d. Carbon goes from an oxidation state of 0 to +4, while carbon goes from 0 to −2, so the  
reaction is a redox type.  
7.14. The skeletal equation of pentane combining with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and  
water is  
C5H12(l) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(g)  
Balancing this equation gives  
C5H12(l) + 8 O2(g) → 5 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(g)  
Plus. The skeletal equation of liquid propanol burning in the presence of oxygen to form  
carbon dioxide and water is  
C3H7 OH(l) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2 O(g)  
Balancing this equation gives  
2 C3H7 OH(l) + 9 O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 8 H2O(g)  
7.15. a. Al changes position with the hydrogen that is bonded with the phosphate, so the  
reaction is a single-displacement type.  
b. Both partners are switched in this reaction, so it is a double-displacement type.  
c. Two species combine to form one species, so this is a synthesis reaction.  
d. One species becomes two separate species, so this is a decomposition reaction.
