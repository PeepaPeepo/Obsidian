[[Survivorship Curves]] are plots of the proportion or numbers in a cohort still alive at each stage.
The three general types include [[Type I Survivorship Curve]], [[Type II Survivorship Curve]], and [[Type III Survivorship Curves]]

[[Type I Survivorship Curve]] is flat at the start and steeply drops at older age groups
	Common in mammals that protect their young
[[Type II Survivorship Curve]] is a curve that sharply drops at the beginning because of rapid death of young. This is common for organisms that mass produce offspring but don't care forthem.
[[Type III Survivorship Curves]] are constant and occurs in ground squirrels and other rodents, invertebrates, lizards, and annual plants.
