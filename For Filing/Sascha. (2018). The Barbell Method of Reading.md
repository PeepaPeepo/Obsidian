[[Barbell Method of Reading]] is broken down into two major steps, and the major idea is to invest in reading that results information that is used. For example, if I read a book about woodwork and didn't actually apply woodwork then it was not an optimal decision.

Read content swiftly and mark passages or concepts that are 'noteworthy'. This can be a key concept, interesting passage, or something that stands out.

Read the content the second time then make those from ideas then connect them with past ideas.
