[[Dispersion]] is the pattern of spacing of [[Individuals]] within a [[Populations]]. This is accounting for populations and its boundaries.

# Patterns of Dispersion

Difference in spacing can show insight of [[Abiotic Factors]] and [[Biotic Factors]] 
Patterns can include [[Clumped Dispersion]], where individuals are in patches
	Common in [[Kingdom Plantae|Plants]] and [[Fungi]]
	Fungi might be clumped on a log
	Can be associated with animal behavior
	Influence individuals success rates in hunting
[[Uniform Dispersion]] is evenly spaced pattern
Some plants secrete chemicals that inhibit germination and growth of nearby individuals 
Animals can exhibit uniformity though [[Territoriality]] the dense of bounded physical space against encroachments 
[[Random Dispersion]] is independent of other individuals
	Absences of strong attraction or repulsion among individuals or factors
	Plants established by wind blown seeds
