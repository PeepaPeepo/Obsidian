w- 3.2 Four emergent properties of water contribute to Earth's suitability for life
- 3.3 Acidic and basic conditions affect living organisms

# How does water's structure allow its solid form float on liquid water?

## Water $H_2O$ is a [[Polar Molecules]]

- O has partial negative charges
- $\delta -$ because O pulls electrons to itself
- H atoms have partial charges $\delta +$

## Weak attractions between oppositely charged regions of water molecules, called [[Hydrogen Bonds]]

- Allows water [[Molecules]]s to bond to each other

## In liquid water, water molecules can slip closer together

- Hydrogen bonds constantly break and re-form

## In ice, water molecules are farther apart

- Hydrogen bonds are stable, ice is lese dense than liquid water
- Causing it to float

## Floating Ice insulates the water below, enabling survival of aquatic life

- Water also has life supporting properties

# Concept 3.1 Polar covalent bonds in water molecules result in hydrogen bonding

- Water molecule is shaped like a wide V
- Two hydrogen atoms joined to the oxygen atom by [[Single Covalent Bonds]] or Single Covalent Bonds
- [[Oxygen]] is more [[Electronegativity|Electronegative]] than [[Hydrogen]]
- Electrons of covalent bond spends more time around oxygen compared to hydrogen
- They are known as [[Polar Covalent Bonds]]s
- Unequal sharing of electrons case water's V shaped molecule make it a [[Polar Molecules]]
	- Overall charge is unevenly distributed
- Oxygen has partial negative charge (delta minus)
- hydrogen has positive charges (delta plus)
- Attraction between oppositely charged atoms of different water molecules
- Hydrogens want to be pulled towards the oxygens and vice versa
- The attraction between the molecules form the basis of [[Hydrogen Bonds]]
	- How does [[Hydrogen Bonds]] relate to [[Molecular Cohesion]]
		- Cohesion is a descriptor of molecules and their ability to stick to its similar molecules
- In liquid form hydrogen bonds are fragile
	- 1/20 as strong as a [[Covalent Bonds|Covalent Bond]]
- They constantly break and re-from with great frequency
- Each lasting only trillionths of a second
- They constantly form new bonds to their neighbors

# Concept Check 3.1

1. MAKE CONNECTIONS What is [[Electronegativity]], and
how does it affect interactions between water molecules?
(Review Figure 2.11.)

- Electronegativity is the potential for an atom to attract another one
- Atoms with more mass and electrons tend to attract other atoms
- Oxygen is negatively charged and attracts the positively charged hydrogens of neighboring water molecules

2. VISUAL SKILLS Look at Figure 3.2 and explain why the
central water molecule can hydrogen-bond to other water
molecules.

- The central oxygen of the molecule has a negative charge attracted to other positive hydrogens in neighboring molecules
- Its positive hydrogens are attracted to the neighboring negative oxygens

3. Why is it unlikely that two neighboring water
molecules would be arranged like this?

- Hydrogen to hydrogen placement doesn't have any opposite charges to attract
- They would most likely repel from each other until their H's latched onto an O

4. WHAT IF? What would be the effect on the
properties of the water molecule if oxygen and hydrogen
had equal electronegativity?

- Molecules would not be attracted to each other
- molecules would follow gravity as if it was sand
- Molecules wouldn't even connect
- It would be appear as single gritty molecules

# Concept 3.2 Four emergent properties of water contribute to Earth's suitability for life 

## Cohesion of Water Molecules

- Water molecules stay close to each other as a result of [[Hydrogen Bonds|Hydrogen Bonding]]
- Hydrogen bonds holding a substance together is a phenomenon as [[Molecular Cohesion]]
- One result of from hydrogen bonding is high [[Surface Tension]]
	- The difficulty of stretching or breaking surface of a liquid
	- Air-water interface is an ordered arrangement of water molecules
	- Hydrogen bonded to one another and to the water below
	- Asymmetry gives water higher surface tension
- Cohesion contributes to transport of water and dissolved nutrients against gravity in plants
- Water travels through water conducting cells
	- Water evaporating from leaves will causes hydrogen bonds to pull up more water
- [[Molecular Adhesion]] is the clinging of one substance to another
	- Hydrogen bonds causes water to cling on to other substances

## Moderation of Temperature by Water

- Water can absorb heat from air
- It is a heat bank because it has a higher heat capacity

## Temperature and Heat

- Anything that moves have [[Kinetic Energy]]
- Atoms and molecules have kinetic energy, they are constantly moving
- The faster a molecule, the greater kinetic energy it has
- The random movements of atoms and molecules is called [[Thermal Energy]]
- [[Temperature]] represents the average kinetic energy of molecules in the body of matter
- Thermal energy reflects total kinetic energy and depends on matter's volume
- Thermal energy passes from warmer to colder until equalized
- Molecules in the cooler object speed up at the expensive of the warmer object
- Thermal energy in transfer from one body of matter to another is defined as [[Heat]]
- [[Food Calories]] (cal) is the amount of heat it takes to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by $1^oC$
	- It conversely is the amount of heat 1 g of water releases when it cools down
- [[Food Calories]] is a kilocalorie (kcal), the quantity of heat needed to raise 1 kilogram of water by $1^oC$
- a [[joules]] is equal to $0.239\ cal$
- a [[Food Calories]] is equal to $4184\ j$

## Water's High Specific Heat

- [[Specific Heat Capacity]] is the amount of heat that must be absorbed or lost for 1 of that substance to change its temperature by $1^oC$ 
- Water has an unusually high specific heat
- Heat must be absorbed to break hydrogen bonds
- Heat is released with hydrogen bonds are formed
- High heat capacity creates temperate climates for marine life

## Evaporative Cooling

- Molecules of any liquid stay close to each other because they are attracted
- Molecules moving fast enough to cover come that attraction enter air as a vapor
- Transition from [[Liquids]] to [[Gases]] is [[Vaporization]] or [[Evaporation]]
- Water at room temperature can evaporate
- [[Heat of Vaporization]] is the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted from liquid to gas
- Water's high heat of vaporization is an emergent property from the strength of the hydrogen bonds
- High heat of vaporization helps moderate climate
- Steam burns are caused from heat energy released during formation of hydrogen bonds when steam condenses into liquid on skin
- As a liquid evaporates, the surface of the liquid that remains behind cools down, known as [[Evaporative Cooling]]
	- The hottest molecules leaves as gas
- High humidity prevents water from vaporizing from surfaces

## Floating of Ice on Liquid Water

- Water is one of few substances that are less dense as a solid compared to liquid
- Water expands when frozen
	- Molecules are moving too slow to break hydrogen bonds
	- Molecules lock into a crystalline lattice
	- Each hydrogen is bonded to four partners
	- Makes ice 10% less dense
	- When ice absorbs enough heat to rise above 0^oC, hydrogen bonds are disrupted

# Water: The Solvent of Life

- A liquid that is a completely [[Homogenous]] mixture of two or more substances is called a [[Solutions]]
- The dissolving agent of a solution is called the [[Solvent]]
- The substance that is being dissolved is called the [[Solubility]]
- An [[Aqueous Solutions]] are [[Solutions]] where the [[Solvent]] is $\ce{ H_{2}O }$
- Water is versatile as as solvent

	- $\delta -$ charge of Oxygen is attracted to Sodium's $\delta +$ charged [[Cations]]
	- $\delta +$ of Hydrogen is attracted to $\delta -$ of Chloride [[Anions]]
- Water molecules surround individual Sodium and Chloride Anion and separates them
- The sphere that surrounds each individual Cation and Anion in this scenario is called a [[Hydration Shells]]
- The solution is now made of two solutes
	- Sodium Cations
	- Chloride Anions
- [[Ionic Compounds]] also dissolve in water
- A [[Compounds]] does not need to be ionic to dissolve in water
- Compounds can be made up of [[Nonionic Polar Molecules]], such as sugar

- The atomic mass can be multiplied by the number of atoms of each element
- Unit measure of molecular mass is a [[mole]] (mol)
- [[Molarity]] is a number of moles of solute per liter of solution
- Often used by biologists

# 3.3 Acidic and basic conditions affect living organisms

- Sometimes in hydrogen atoms in [[Hydrogen Bonds|hydrogen bonds]] shift to another molecule
	- Hydrogen leaves its electrons behind and transfers as a [[Hydrogen Ion]], $H^+$
	- A single proton with a charge of $1+$
- The molecule that lost a proton becomes a [[Hydroxide]] $\ce{ OH^- }$
	- Has a charge of $1-$
- The lone H proton binds to another molecule making a new molecule, [[Hydronium Ions]] $\ce{ H_{3}O^+ }$
- $\ce{ 2 H_{2}O <-> H_{3}O^+ + OH^-}$
- $H^+$ is used to represent $H_3O^+$
	- H^+ cannot exist as its own
	- Always associated with a water molecule
- Double arrows mean reaction is reversible
	- Reaches a state of dynamic equilibrium
	- water molecules dissociate at the same rate they are reforming from H^+ and OH^-
- Concentration of $H^+$ and $OH^-$ is $10^-7 M$ at $25^oC$
-  $H^+$ and $OH^-$ are highly reactive
- Changes in concentration can affect cell's proteins and other molecules
- Are equal in pure water
- Adding certain [[Acids|acids]] and [[Bases|bases]] disrupts the balance
- pH scale is used to describe acidity

# The [[pH Scale]]

- Aqueous solutions at $25^oC$ the product of H^+ and OH^- concentration is constant at $10^{-14}$

$$\ce{ [H^+][OH^-]=10^{-14} }$$

- Brackets indicate molar concentration
$$\ce{ [H^+] = 10^{-7}}$$

$$\ce{ [OH^-] = 10^-{7} }$$

- The product of the two will equal $10^{-7}$

$$\ce{ [H^+] * [OH^-] = 10^{-14} }$$

- pH scale is a numerical method for expressing range of $H^+$ concentration
- [[Potential of Hydrogen]] of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of $H^+$

$$\ce{ pH = -\log_{(10)}[H^+] }$$

- Base 10 is omitted in scientific equations
- Each pH unit represents a tenfold difference in $H^+$
