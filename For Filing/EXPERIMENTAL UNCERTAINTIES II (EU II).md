1. [[Random Uncertainty]] are affected by uncontrollable factors and can only be obtained by repeating measurements
1. $R_{best}$ values are just an average of a multiple measurements
2. Running averages are averages of data points up to a certain point
3. Data looks to be linear in a graph after 25 measurements
4. Careful experimentation can lead to less deviation
4. [[Standard Deviation]] is the amount of spread of multiple readings
5. Uncertainty is equal to the Standard Deviation, $\sigma$, divided by the square root of number of samples
