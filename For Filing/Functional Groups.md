- [[Atoms]] or groups of atoms within a molecule that has similar chemical properties whenever it appears in various [[Compounds|Compounds]]
- There are seven main groups in biological processes
	- [[Hydroxyl Groups]] $\ce{ -OH }$
	- [[Carboxyl Groups]] $\ce{ -COOH (-C=O + -OH)}$
	- [[Carbonyl Groups]] $\ce{ :C=O }$
	- [[Sulfhydryl Group]] $\ce{ -SH }$
	- [[Methyl Group]] $\ce{ -CH_{3} }$
	- [[Phosphate Groups]] $\ce{ -OPO_{3}^- }$
	- [[Amino Group]] $\ce{ -NH_{2} }$
- All but sulfhydryl group is [[Hydrophilic]], it increases solubility in water
- Methyl group is not reactive, but it is a recognizable tag on organic molecules 
- Functional groups attach to [[Carbon Skeletons]]
- Each have important distinct properties such as [[Acids|acidity]], [[Hydrophilic]], and [[Hydrophobic]]
