[[Promoters]] are specific regions of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] where [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerase]] and [[Transcription Factors]] can attach to form a [[Transcription Initiation Complex]] and start the [[Transcription]] process.

The main parts of [[Promoters]] are the [[TATA Box]] and the [[Transcription Start Points]]; the [[TATA Box]] is about 25 [[Nucleotide Triphosphate|NTPs]] upstream from the [[Transcription Start Points]]

The [[TATA Box]] can be recognized by specific [[Transcription Factors]] which guide [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II|RNA Polymerase II]].
