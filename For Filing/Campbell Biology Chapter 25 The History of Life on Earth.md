Changes in fossils show [[Macroevolution]]

# Concept 25.1 Conditions on early Earth made the origin of life possible

[[Abiotic Factors]] [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of small organic molecules such as amino acids and nitrogenous bases
Joining into [[Macromolecules]] such as [[Proteins]] and [[Nucleic Acids]]
packaging into [[Protocells]], droplets with [[Membranes]] that maintained an internal chemistry different from surroundings 
Origin of self-replicating molecules that eventually made inheritance possible

# Synthesis of Organic Compounds on Early Earth

Earth was bombarded by rock and ice from solar system
Collisions generated heat until water was vaporized 
First atmosphere was thin
Compounds released by volcanic eruptions
Water vapor into oceans
Earth's early atmosphere was reducing (electron adding)
Energy for synthesis from lightning and UV radiation
Primitive soup from life arose
[[Stanley Miller]] and [[Harold Urey]] tested Oparin-Haldane hypothesis
Early atmosphere was made of nitrogen and carbon dioxide
[[A. I. Oparin]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] independently hypothesized that early atmosphere was a reducing environment

Introduction of organic compounds from [[Hydrothermal Vents]]
on the sea floor known as black smokers release extreme hot water
[[Alkaline Vents]] release high pH 9 - 11
Synthesis of o molecules are possible under specific conditions
meteorites can contain a lot of amino acids
organisms make and only use l isomers
other meteorites contain other organic molecules such as lipids and simple sugars
Amino acids were formed under conditions simulating volcanic eruption

## Abiotic Synthesis of Macromolecules

Dripping solutions of amino acids or RNA onto hot sand clay or rock produces polymers with out help of enzymes or ribosomes

## Protocells

Organisms must carry out reproduction and energy processing (Metabolism) Self replicating molecules and metabolic source of building blocks may have appeared in early [[Protocells]]
conditions may een met in [[Vesicles]] can show properties of life
Simple growth without dilution of contents
repdocution 
metabolism
maintence of internal environment different from surrounding

Vesicles can form when lipids are added to water, there is hyrdrophobic region and hydrophilic region
[[Montmorillonite]] increases rate of vesicle assembly
Vesicles hve selectively permeable bilayer 

## Self-Replicating RNA

First genetic material was most liely RNA
It can function as enzyme life catalyst
[[Ribozymes]] can make complementary copies of short peices of RNA if supplide with nucleotides
[[Theory of Natural Selection|Natural Selection]] of on molecular level has produced ribozymes
Some RNA moelcule shapes allow higher repdocutive rates
RNA molecule can have more descendants
Copying error can cause a beneficial mutation

# Concept 25.2 The fossil record documents the histroy of life

## The fossil record

Sedimentary rocks are riches source of fossils
Insects in amber and mammals frozen in soil
Shows great changes in kinds of organisms at differente time
Many of earths organisms did not die i nthe right place and time to be preserved
In favor of speicies with hard tissue

## How Rocks and Fossils are Dated

[[Radiometric Dating]] based on decay of radioactive isotopes
Parent isotopes decay into a daughter isotope at a characteristic rate
Rate of decay is represented by [[Half-Life]] is time required for 50% of parent to decay
Most living organisms contain carbon 12 and carbon 14
Measure ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 can determine fossils age
but only good for 75000 years
Measure surrounding volanic material of fossils that contain radioisotopes

## The Origin of new groups of organisms

Mamals bleong to [[Tetrapoda]] which is four foot in greek
Mammals originated from a group of tetrapods caleld [[Synapsids]]
Lower jaw is composed of one bone, the dentary
Mammals have unique set of three bones that transmit sound in hte middle ear
Hammer, andvil and stirrup
Tetrapods have one
Mammalian teeth
Incisors for teering
canines for piercings
molars for crushing and grinding

# Concept 25.3 Key events in lifes history include the origins of unicellular and multicelluar organisms and teh colonization of land

First three eons in the geologic record
[[Hadean Eon]]
[[Archaean Eon]]
[[Proterzoic Eon]]
and all lasted in combination 4 billion years
[[Phanerzoic Eon]] is roughly the last half billion years and divided into three ears
[[Paleozoic Era]]
[[Mesozoic Era]]
[[Cenozoic Era]]

[[Mesozoic Era]] is calle dthe age of reptiles

## The First Single Celled Organisms

Single celled [[Prokaryotes]] that lived in the oceans
Earliest evedience from 3.5 billion years ago of fossilized [[Stromatolites]]
are layered rocks that form when certain prokaryotes bind thin films of sediment together

## Photosynthesis and the Oxygen Revolution

Most O_2 produced during water splitting step of photosyntheiss
Oxygen is biological origin
free oxtgen probably dissolved in the surrounding water until reached high enough concentration to react with elements in water including iron
Iron oxide by product
sidement was compressed into banded iron containing iron oxide
surated seas and lakes with oxyen
oxygen gas outof water to enter atmopshere 
atmount of atmospheric gas increased from 2.7 to 2.4 billion years ago
Oxygen attacks chemical bonds nd can inhibit enzmes and damage cells
o2 doomed many prokaryotic groups
some speciies survied and remained anerobic
adap to celluar resipiration

## First Eukaryotes

Eukaryotic cells have more complex organization than projaryotic cells
Cells hav nuclear envlope, mithondira, er, and other organells prokaryotic cells lack
Cytoskeletons are present
Eukaryote originatin by [[Endosymbiosis]] and [[Endosymbiont]]
when a prokaryotic cell engulfed by a small cell that would elovle into an organelle found in all eukaryote, the mitochondrion
[[Endosymbiont Theory]] a cell that lives within another host cell
undigest prey or interal parasite
Symbisosi could have happened
endosymbionts would become a single organisms
[[Serial Endosymbiosis]] hyptoehsis supposes that mitochondira evoleved before plastids through sequence of endosymnioitic events
Inner memebranes of both organelles have enzymes and transport sysdtems
Mitochondria and plastics replicate by splitting process that is similar to that of certain bacteria
Organelles descneded from free living organsims
RNA Sequences and snesitivity from certain antiioits, the mitochondria and plastids are more similar to bacterial ribosomes than cytoplasmic ribosomes of eukaryra
Some of their membranes proteins are homologous to those in bacterial membranes
replication is similar to bacterial cell division
chromosome and dna structure is similar to bacteria
transcribe and  translate their own dna
ribosomes are similar to those of bacteria in size, rna sequenec ,and antibioitiy sensitivitiy                  

## Origin of Multicellularity

### Early Multicellular Eukaryotes

Muilticellular eukaryotes emerged about 1.3 billion years ago
Oldest evidence is red algea that lived 1.2 billion years ago
Larger and more diverse multicellular eukaryotes do not appear in teh ofssiel about 600 million years ago
fossils are [[Ediacaran Biota]], soft bodiedf organisms
included algae and animals
Rise of eukaryotes in the ediacaran period shows change in history of life

### The Cambrian Explosion

Present day animal [[Phyla]] appeared in fossils 535 - 525 million years ago during [[Cambarian Period]] and the phenoeonn is the [[Cambarian Explosion]] several animal groups, sponges, cnindarians, and molluscs appear in older rocks since [[Proterzoic]] era
Grazing animals, filter feeders, or scavenger in pre cambrian era
Predators over 1 m look emerged, new defensive dapataions such as spines and body armor appeared
DNA suggest sponges had evlolved by 700 million years ago
Animal phyla radiated during cambrian explosion 670 million years ago
seteroids indicative of a particualr group of sponges

### Colonization of Land

Fungi, plants, and animals didn't begin to colonize land untill 500 million years ago
many plants hav e vascular system for transporting materials interally
roots of most plants are associated with fungi that aid in the abosrption of water and minerals
Root fungi obtain organic nutrients from plants
animals are arthropods and tetrapods
arthropods were among the first animals to colonize land
tetrapods appeared about 365 million years ago and eloved from lobe finned fishes
tetrapods include humans
Human lineages diverged from other primates around 6- 7 million years go, ourspeiceis isa bout 195,000 years ago

# Concept 25.4 The rise and fall of groups of organisms reflect difference in speciatio nand extinction rates 

anerobic prokaryotes originated and delcined
anmphibians wen on to dominate life until tetrapods replaced tehm 
just as population icnreases in size whenre there are more births than deaths, the rise of a group of organisms occus when more new species are produced thant are lost to extinction

## Plate Tectonics

[[Plate Tectonics]] the continents are part of a greate lpats of earths crust that essentialy float on hot underlying pertion of mantel
[[Continental Drift]] over time
PLates are moving a few centimeters a year
Geological precsses inluding fomratio nof mountains and island occur at plate boundaries

## Consequences of Continental Drift

Plate movements brough previously separated landmasses together into [[Pangaea]]
Most marine species inhabited shallow waters
Pangeas interrior was cold and dry
Organisms are also affected by climate change that results when a content shifts its location
Organisms adap to new changes
Continental drift promotes [[Allopatric Speciation]]

Australia has a lot of marsupials

## Mass Extinction

a lot of species are extint
[[Mass Extinctions]]

## The big five mass extinction events (Page 540)

Two mass extinctions

[[Permian Extinction]] 96% of mairien speiceis became extinct in less than 500 years
volcanisims 1.6 km&2 in siberia
CO2 dram atic
global warming
ocean acidfication reduce calcium carbonate reef building
nutrient enrichment of ocneas caused microbial blooms leading to anoxic conidionts
[[Cretaceous Extinction]]
66 million years ago
1/2 of marine specieis many familes of terrestia lplants and animals went extinct
iridrium in sendimentary rocks suggest meteorites 
current extinction rate is about 100:1000 times the backgroudn rate
destruction of tropical forests

## Adaptive radiation

rapid period of evolutionary change where many new species arise and andapt to different ecologic niches
adaptive radations can occur inrespose to opening of niches
evolution of novel chracterisitcs
colonization of new rgeions with few or weak competitors
rise of photosynthetic prokaryotes
evoltuio nof large predators in cambrian explosion
coloiztaion of ladn by plants insects and teterapods

## World wide adaptive radiation

groups diversified as adaptive radations in groups
insects followed diversification of plants tehy ate 

## Regional

limited to saml lregions

silversword alliance of the hawaiian archipelago

# Concept 25.5 major changes in body form can result from changes in the sequeneces and regulatio nof development

## Allometric Growth

Various rates of growth of different parts of body

[[Heterochrony]]
[[Paedomorphosis]] is teh development of reproductive organs accelerates relative to toher organs
Axolotl retains certain larval tadpole characteristics

## Changes in spatial pattern

[[Homeotic Genes]] are master regulatory genes that determine where an organisms features will develop
[[Hox Genes]] a class of homeotic genes provide positional information in animal embyros
	if hox gene position expression changes, the corresponding part changes

## Changes in gene sequences

[[New Developmental Genes]]

## Changes in gene regulation

caused by mutation affecting developmental gene regulation

# Concept 25.6 Evolution is not goal oriented

new forms arise by slight midification of existing structures or developmental genes 
most novel biological stuctures evolve in many stages
[[Exaptation]] are structures that evolve in one context, but bcome co opted fora different function
[[Species Selection]]
[[Evolutionary Trends]]
