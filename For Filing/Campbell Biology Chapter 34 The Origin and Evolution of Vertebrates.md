Key characteristics of [[Vertebrata]] are [[Skull]] and [[Backbone]] made of [[Vertebrae]], [[Jaws]], and [[Mineralized Bony Skeletons]], [[Lobed Fins]], [[Limbs with Digits]], [[Amniotic Eggs]]

More than 60,000 Species of [[Vertebrata]], [[Animalia]] with [[Backbone]]
Largest animal on earth is the [[Blue Whale]]
*Schindleria brevipinguis* is 8.4 mm long
[[Notochord]]

# Concept 34.1 Chordates have a notochord and a dorsal, hollow nerve cord

[[Chordata]] includes [[Vertebrata]] called [[Chordates]]
[[Chordates]] are [[Bilaterian]] 
[[Bilateria]] is a clade that includes the clade [[Deuterostomia]]
[[Deuterostomia]] includes [[Cephalochordata]] and the [[Urochordates]]

## Derived Characters of Chordates

All [[Chordates]] share a set of characters, some only during embryonic development
[[Notochord]] is a dorsal hollow nerve cord
[[Pharyngeal Slits]]
Muscular post anal tail

## Notochord

[[Chordates]] are named for their [[Notochord]], it is present in all embryos and in some adault chordates.
[[Notochord]] is a longitudinal, flexible rod located between the digestive tubes and the nerve chord. It is composed of fluid filled cells in fibrous tissue, it provides skeletal support throughout most of the chordate
Most vertebrates develop a jointed skeleton around it

## Dorsal, Hollow Nerve Chord

Nerve of chordate embryo develops from a plact of ectoderm that roles into a neural tube located to the notochord
Other animals have solid nerve cords and located in the ventral side
Nerve cord of a chordate embryo develops into the central nervous system the [[Brain]] and [[Spinal Cord]]

## Pharyngeal Slits or Clefts

The digest tube of chordates extends from mouth to anus
Region posterior to the mouth is the [[Pharynx]]
In all chordate embryos, a series of arches separated by grooves form along the touter surface of the pharynx
The groves are [[Pharyngeal Clefts]] that develop into slits [[Pharyngeal Slits]]
The slits allow water to enter and exit mouth
It acts a s suspension feeding 
Vertebrates adapted to modify the slits into gills
Tetrapods have the slits turn into parts of the ear and other structures

# Class Amphibia

[[Amphibia]]
	6150 species
	[[Order Urodela]]
	Some are aquatic
	Paedomorphosis is the retention of larval features sexually mature is a common in aquatic species

	5420 Species of frogs
	Typically lack tails and have powerful hind legs
	Leathery skin are called toads
[[Order Apoda]]
	170 species
	Leglist and blind 
	Moist soil in tropical areas
[[Amphibia]] both ways of life
Stages of many frogs start in water
Aquatic herbivoers
Metamorphosis, tadpoles develop terrestial features
Gills and the lateral line system disappear and the dgiest system is adapted

## Lifestyle and ecology

[[Caecilian Larvae]] look
Eggs lack a shell, needs moisture
External fertilization
High mortalitiy rates
Some parents carry their eggs
Male frog vocalize to defend breeding territory or attract
Celestial navigation
Decline in amphibian population
Diseases causing chytrid fungus, habitat loss, climage change, polluion
9 species have become extin over 40 years 
More than 100 are considered extinct

# Concept 34.5 Amniote are tetrapods that have terrestrially adapted egg

[[Amniotes]] have [[Amniotic Eggs]] which contain four membranes that protect the embryo
Key adaptation for life on land, the egg reduced dependence on water
Four extraembryonic membranes include the amnion, chorion, yolk sac, and allantois
[[Extraembryonic Membranes]]

[[Amnion]] is a fluid filled
Shells slow down dehydration
Most mammals have lost eggshell and develop the embryo within the mothers body
Lung breathing, amniotes became less depended on gas exchange through sknin

## Early Amniotes

[[Ectothermic]] absorbing external heat as main source of body heat
Birds are [[Endothermic Reactions|Endothermic]]

## The Origin and Evolutionary Radiation of Reptiles

[[Diapsids]] have a pair of holes on the skull t

[[Turtles]]
[[Lepidosauria]]
[[Archosauria]]

## Lizards and Snake

Squamates range in size from the tiny jaragua lizard to the komodo dragon
Snakes are descended from lizards, retention of vestigial pelvic and limb bones
Snakes move on land via waves
Belly scales to grip the ground
Carnivorous
	Chemical Sensors
	Tactile
	Head Detecting Organs
	Tounge flicking
