![[Law of Conservation of Energy]]

### Science and Realm of Physics

[[Science]] consists of [[Scientific Theory|Theories]] and [[Scientific Law|Laws]] that are general truths of nature as well as body of knowledge they encompass

[[Physics]] describes the interaction of [[Energy]], [[Matter]], [[Space]], and [[Time]], and the fundamental mechanisms that underly every phenomenon

It aims to explain everything around us

### Application of Physics

Physics is useful in nonscientific professions
It is foundation of important disciplines such as chemistry
Architecture uses physics as reference for stability
Biological science uses it to describe properties of [[Cell Membranes]] and [[Cell Walls]] 

### Models, Theories and Laws; The Role of Experimentation

[[Models]] are representation of something that is too hard to represent directly
It is only accurate under limited situations, like 3-d sample structures of [[Atoms]]

[[Scientific Theory|Theories]] are explanation for patterns in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and verified by groups of researchers 

[[Scientific Law|Laws]] use concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature that is supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments

They can be expressed in form of a single mathematical equation

They are similar to theories because they are supported by evidence

[[Designation law]] are reserved for concise and general statements that describe phenomena in nature

[[Newton's Second Law of Motion]] is $F= ma$ 

Theories are complex and dynamic, laws describe a single action

[[Scientific Method]] is a process for inquiring and gathering information

### The evolution of natural philosophy into modern physics

Physics from from Greek meaning Nature
Study of nature was Natural Philosophy
Physics from renaissance to end of 19th century is called [[Classical Physics]] then modernized during 20th century

[[Classical Physics]] approximate that [[Matter]] is moving at speeds less than 1% of light etc

[[Modern Physics]] consists of [[Relativity]] and [[Quantum Mechanics]] which deal with high speeds and tiny sizes

Combination of [[Relativity]] and [[Quantum Mechanics]] is [[Relativistic Quantum Mechanics]] that describe small objects moving at high speeds

## 1.2 Physical Quantities and Units

### Learning Objectives

- Perform Unit conversions from SI and English Units
- Explain common prefixes in SI units and scientific Notation

Most [[Physical Quantity]] can be expressed as combinations of four fundamental ones: [[Length]], [[Mass]], [[Time]], and [[Electrical Current]]

[[Physical Quantity]] is defined by specifying how it was measured or calculated from other measurements.

Measurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of [[Units]], which are standardized values

Two major systems of units are [[Système International|Si Units]] and [[English Units]]

### SI Units: Fundamental and Derived Units

[[Fundamental Units]] include [[Meter]], [[Kilograms]], [[Seconds]], and [[Amperes]] for [[Length]], [[Mass]], [[Time]], and [[Electrical Current]]
[[Fundamental Units]] can be only defined in terms they are measured in
[[Fundamental Physical Quantities]] that are measured in [[Fundamental Units]] are [[Mass]], [[Time]], [[Length]], and [[Electrical Current]]

Other physical quantities can be expressed by algebraic combinations of the fundamental units and are called [[Derived Units]]

### Units of time, length, and mass: second, meter, and kilogram

[[Seconds]] are based on [[Cesium]] [[Atoms]] and its vibrations. One second is the time required for a Cesium atom to vibrate 9,192,631,770

[[Meter]] is equal to 1the distance of light travelled in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second

[[Kilograms]] is in terms of the second, the meter, and [[Planck's Constant]] $h$

### Metric Prefixes

[[Système International|Metric System]] categorize units in factors of 10

[[Order of Magnitude]] refers to the scale of a value expressed in the metric system, if they are in the same "category" they are in the same magnitude

### Known Ranges of Length, Mass, and Time

#### Unit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis

[[Conversion Factors]] are ratios expressing one unit equal to another

## 1.3 Accuracy, Precision, and Significant Figures

### Learning Objectives

- Determine the appropriate number of significant figures in addition and subtraction as well as multiplication and division
- Calculate Percent uncertainty of a measurement 

### Accuracy and Precision of a Measurement

[[Accuracy]] is teh how close a measurement is to the correct value of the measurement

[[Precision]] of a measurement of a system refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements

### Accuracy, Precision, and Uncertainty

Degree of accuracy and precision of a measuring system are related to the [[Uncertainty]] in measurements
It is quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from standard or expected value

### Percent Uncertainty

![[Percent Uncertainty]]

### Uncertainties in Calculations

![[Method of Adding Percents]]

can be used for multiplication or division

### Precision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures

[[Significant Figures]] states that the last digit written is the first digit with some [[Uncertainty]]

#### Zeros

Zeros are significant except when they serve only as place keepers
Zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant depending on style of writing numbers, ambiguity is avoided by writing in scientific notation

#### Significant Figures in Calculations

When combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of sig figs cannot be greater than the number of the least precise measured value

Multiplication and Division rules state that result should have the same amount of sig figs as the quantity with least sig figs

Addition and Subtraction rules state that the answer cannot have more decimal places than the least precise measurement

#### Significant Figures in This Text

Most numbers are assumed to have 3 sigfigs
Exact numbers do no affect number of Sig figs

## 1.4 Approximation

### Learning Objectives

- Make reasonable approximations based on given data

[[Approximations]] are guestimates for a particular quantity 

# Chapter 2 Kinematics

[[Kinematics]] is the study of motion without considering its causes

## 2.1 Displacement

### Learning Objectives

- Define position, displacement, distance, and distance traveled
- Relationship between position and displacement
- Displacement and distance traveled
- Calculate displacement and distance with initial position, final position, and path

### Position

[[Position]] is the location of an object at any [[Time]] specified to a [[Reference Frame]]

Relate objects to stationary objects

### Displacement

[[Displacement]] is the change of position of an object, it implies movement or displacement

Displacement has direction and magnitude


### Distance 

[[Distance]] is the magnitude, or size of displacement of two positions, it is not the same as distance traveled

[[Distance Traveled]] is the total length of the path traveled between two positions

## 2.2 Vectors, Scalars, and Coordinate Systems

### Learning Objectives

- Define and Distinguish between scalar and vector quantities
- Coordinate systems for a scenarios in 1D

[[Distance]] is defined by magnitude, and its a [[Scalar]] quantity
[[Displacement]] is defined by direction and magnitude/distance
[[Vectors]] are any quantity with [[Magnitude]] and [[Direction]]
	Example includes 90 km/h east or 500 newtons straight down
Vectors are represented by arrows
[[Scalar]] is any quantity that has a magnitude and no direction

### Check your understanding

A person’s speed can stay the same as they round a corner and changes direction. Given this information, is speed a scalar or a vector quantity? Explain.
	Speed is scalar because it lacks a direction, speed stays the same regardless of change in direction

## 2.3 Time, Velocity, and Speed

### Learning Objectives

- Relationship between instantaneous velocity, average velocity, instantaneous speed, average speed, displacement, and time 
- Calculate velocity and speed with Initial position, initial time, final position, and final time
- graph velocity vs time with position vs time
- interpret graph of velocity vs time

### Time

[[Time]] is change or interval over which change occurs.
[[Elapsed Time]], $\ce{ \Delta t }$, is the difference between ending time and beginning time.

### Velocity

[[Average Velocity]] is [[Displacement]]/[[Time]] of travel
$\ce{ v= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}  }$

[[Instantaneous Velocity]], $\ce{v\ }$, is the average velocity at a specific time or infinitesimally small time interval

### Speed

[[Speed]] has no direction and is a [[Scalar]] quantity
[[Instantaneous Speed]] is the magnitude of [[Instantaneous Velocity]]
[[Average Speed]] is the distance traveled divided by [[Elapsed Time]]
	It can be greater than average velocity because of distance traveled

## 2.4 Acceleration

### Learning Objectives

- Define and distinguish between instantaneous acceleration, average acceleration, and deceleration
- Calculate acceleration with given initial time, initial velocity, final time, and final velocity

[[Average Acceleration]] is the rate of change of [[Velocity]]:

$$\ce{ \bar{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} }$$
$\ce{ \bar{a} }$ is average [[Acceleration]]
$\ce{ \Delta v }$ is change in [[Velocity]]
$\ce{ \Delta t }$ is change in [[Time]]

[[Velocity]] is a vector that contains magnitude and direction, it can be affected by change in speed or direction.

[[Acceleration]] are [[Vectors]] in same direction as change in velocity
The slow down of an object is [[Deceleration]]

Slow down can be either deceleration or negative acceleration. 

### Instantaneous Acceleration

[[Instantaneous Acceleration]], $\ce{ a }$, is [[Acceleration]] at a specific [[Time]]
Choose [[Average Acceleration]] to find an [[Instantaneous Acceleration]]
If the average of an entire interval is nearly the same as [[Instantaneous Acceleration]] equal to the average
In intervals with drastic changes, break them up into similar sections and create an average from each.

**Continue from Example 2.6 Calculating Average Velocity: the Subway Train**

## 2.5 Motion Equations for Constant Acceleration in One Dimension

### Learning objectives

- Calculate Displacement of an object that is not accelerating with initial position and velocity
- Calculate final velocity of accelerating project, given initial velocity, acceleration, and time 
- Calculate displacement and final position of accelerating object with given initial position, initial velocity, time, and acceleration

### Notation with t, x, c, and a

$\ce{ \Delta t=t }$
t = final time
x = final position
c = final velocity
$\ce{ \Delta x = x - x_{0} }$
$\ce{ \Delta v = v\ - v_{0} }$
Average acceleration is instantaneous acceleration are equal in this setting
$\ce{ \bar{a} = a = constant }$

$\ce{ \bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} }$
$\ce{ \bar{v} = \frac{{x-f_{0}}}{t} }$

$$\ce{ \bar{v} = \frac{v_{0} + v\ }{2} }$$

The above equation shows that with constant acceleration v = simple average of initial and final velocities

$x = x_{0}+\bar{v}t$ shows that [[Displacement]] is a linear function of [[Average Velocity]]

### Solving for final velocity
$a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$
$v=v_{0}+at$ (constant acceleration)
### Solving for final position and velocity is not constant

$$v-v_{0}+at$$
$$\bar{v}=v_{0}+\frac{1}{2}at$$
$$x=x_{0}+\bar{v}t$$
$$x=x_{0}+x_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
### Putting Equations Together

$x=x_{0}+\bar{v}t$
$\bar{v}=\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}$
$v=v_{0}+at$
$x=x_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}at^2$
$v^2=v_{0}^2+2a(x-x_{0})$

$x$ is final position
$\bar{v}$ is average velocity


## 2.6 Problem-Solving Basics for One Dimensional Kinematics 

### Learning Objectives

2. Check if reasonable
3. Look for any issues

## Falling Objects

### Learning Objectives

- Describe effects of gravity on objects in motion
- Motion in free fall
- Calculate position and velocity in free fall

### Gravity

If [[Air Resistance]] and [[Friction]] are negligible, all objects fall towards center of earth at same constant acceleration, independent of their [[Mass]]

[[Free-fall]] is an object falling without [[Air Resistance]] or [[Friction]]

[[Acceleration due to gravity]] is the acceleration of a free falling object. It is a constant value. It has its own symbol $g$, and has a value of 

$$g=9.8\ m / s^2$$

$g$ can vary depending on latitude, altitude, etc. Direction of gravity is downwards to center of earth. It defines vertical. If upward direction is positive then a = -g. Vice versa if flipped.

### One-Dimensional Motion involving gravity

#### Kinematic Equations for objects in Free-Fall where Acceleration = -g

$$v=v_{0}-gt$$
$$y=y_{0}+v_{0}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$
$$v^2=v_{0}^2-2g(y-y_{0})$$

## 2.8 Graphical Analysis of One-Dimensional Motion

### Learning Objectives

- describe straight line graph in terms of its slope and y-intercept
- average velocity or instantaneous velocity from a graph of position vs time
- Average or instantaneous acceleration from a graph of velocity vs time
- graph of velocity vs time from graph of position vs time
- Graph of acceleration vs time from a graph of velocity vs time

### Slopes and General Relationships

When two physical quantities are plotted against one another in a graph, the horizontal axis is the [[Independent Variable]] and vertical axis is [[Dependent Variable]]

Straight line graphs have the general form

$$y=mx+b$$

$m$ is the [[Slope]], the rise divided by run
$b$ is the [[y-intercept]], the point where the line crosses the vertical axis

### Graph of Position vs. Time (a = 0, so v is constant)

[[Time]] is usually an independent variable
Slope is the same as [[Average Velocity]], $\bar{v}$
The [[y-intercept]] is the position at [[Time]] 0, $x_{0}$

$$x=\bar{v}t+x_{0}$$

### Graph of Motion when a is constant but a is not 0

Non constant acceleration leads to curved lines
Slope at any point on a is instantaneous velocity
Found by drawing a straight line tangent to curve

Slope of a velocity versus time graph is acceleration
slope is rise divded by run
Rise = change in velocity, delta v
run is change in time delta t

Stope of a graph of v vs time is a

# Chapter 4 Dynamics: Force and Newton's Laws of Motion

[[Dynamics]] considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems

## 4.1 Developmental of Force Concept

[[Force]] is a push or a pull, it is a [[Vectors|vector]]
[[Free-body diagram]] is a technique to illustrate all the [[External forces]] acting on a body
[[Restoring Force]]

## 4.2 Newton's First Law of Motion: Inertia

[[Newton's first law of motion]] states that a body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.

### Mass

The property of a body to remain still or in motion is [[Inertia]] and it is measured by mass

## 4.3 Newton's Second Law of Motion: Concept of a System

[[Newton's Second Law of Motion]] states that cause and effect relationship between force and changes in motion.

A change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity
[[External forces]] acts from outside [[Systems]]
$$a \propto F_{net}$$
[[Net external force]] is the vector sum of all external forces and cand be determined graphically

Acceleration is directly proportional to the net external force
Inversely proportionate mass of a system
$$a \propto \frac{1}{m}$$
### Newton's Second Law of Motion

$$a=\frac{F_{net}}{m}$$

### Units of Force

[[Newton]], $N$, is the force needed to accelerate a 1 kg system at the rate of  $1 \ m/s^2$
United States uses pounds

### Weight and the Gravitational Force

[[Weight]], $w$, is a vector downwards same as gravity
It is equal to its mass times gravity

$$F_{net}=ma$$

When the net external force on an object is its weight, then it is in [[Free-fall]]
The only force is gravity

### 4.4 Newton's Third Law of Motion: Symmetry in Forces




# Chapter 5 Further Applications of Newton's Laws: Friction, Drag, and Elasticity

198. Friction is an opposing force between two forces, but not all the time
198. Two types of friction: Kinetic Friction and Static Friction. Static friction is typically stronger and follows the idea of inertia
199. Magnitude of static friction is $f_{s}<\mu_{s}N$, static friction coefficient multiplied by Normal force
199. There is an implication there can be a minimum
200. or maximum of friction, which needs to be overpowered to move an object
201. Kinetic Friction almost has the same equation as static friction but is set equal to it.
202. Added the coefficient to N normal force is the move for most cases
203. Rubbing of to objects lead to vibration and soundwaves that turn into heat
204. Drag force is force that occurs when something is moving through a gas or liquid. Like friction opposes motion but proportional to velocity in a specific way. It is proportionate to Velocity Squared. Equation in this case is $F_{D}=\frac{1}{2}CpAv^2$
205. Stoke's Law states that drag force is proportionate to velocity but changes when an object is very small
206. Changes in shape caused by force is deformation and it is proportionate to force
207. Tensile Strength is the amount of stress that can permanently break an object or fracture them
208. Ratio of force to area is stress, the change of length is strain
209. Shear deformation is perpendicular force
