Living things contain nucleic acids, protenins, carbs and lipids
Composed of cells
Cells are smallest units of life
HUmans have trillion
Living things reproduce

[[Bacteria]] 
Living things use energy and raw materials
Maintain homeostasis
Natural Selection

Organisms

Living things

Viruses cannot do all of the living things can
Depends on organisms

# Five unifying themes in Biology

[[Organization]]
[[Information]]
[[Energy]] and [[Matter]]
[[Evolution]]
[[Interactions]]
[[Alleles]]

[[Hetereozygous]] and [[Homozygous]]

[[Macromolecules]]

[[Carbohydrates]]
	[[Glucose]]
	[[Lactose]]
	[[Chitin]]
	[[Glycogen]]
	[[Cellulose]]

[[Lipids]]
	[[Glycerol]]
	[[Fatty Acids]]
	[[Cholesterols]]

[[Proteins]]
[[Nucleic Acids]]

# New Properties emerge at successive levels of biological organization

1. [[Biosphere]]
2. [[Ecosystems]]
3. [[Communities]]
4. [[Populations]]
5. [[Organisms]]
6. [[Organs]]
7. [[Tissues]]
8. [[Cells]]
9. [[Organelles]]
10. [[Molecules]]

# The Cell An organisms basic unit of structure and function

[[Cells]] are the smallest unit of organization that perform all acativieis
Living [[Organisms]] are made from cells
[[Cells]] are enclosed with [[Membranes]]
[[Prokaryotes|Prokaryotic]] vs [[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] cells

[[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] have membranes and large nucleus
[[Prokaryotes|Prokaryotic]] are simpler

## Life's Processes invole the expression and transmission of genetic information

[[Chromosomes]] contain [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] 
Each [[Chromosomes]] contain one long [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] with hundreds or thousands of [[Genes]]
[[Genes]] are units of inheritance
[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] is made up of the [[Monomers]], [[Nucleotides]] 
20,000 Genes
[[Intervening Sequences|Introns]]

# Gene Expression

[[Nucleotide Sequences]] contain information for [[Proteins]] [[Gene Expression|Expression]]
DNA to mRNA to amino acids to proteins

# Genomics: LArge Scale Analysis of DNA Sequences

[[Genomes]] are the entire library of genetic instructions
[[Genomics]] are the study of the whole sets
[[Proteomics]] study all the proteins
[[Proteome]] is a set of proteins
[[Bioinformatics]] use computational tools to process a large volume of data 

# Life requires the transfer and transformation of energy and matter

[[Chemical Energy]] can be produced by [[Kingdom Plantae]] and other [[Photosynthesis|Photosynthetic]] [[Organisms]], known as [[Producers]]. The energy is passed on to [[Consumers]], which are organisms that consume producers or their remains.

# From molecules to ecosystems, interactions are important in biological systems

Organism interactions between components of system

# An organisms interactions with others

# Evolution accounts for the unity and diversity of life

# The Three Domains of Life

The three domains of life are [[Bacteria]], [[Archaea]], and [[Eukarya]]
[[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] fall under [[Prokaryotes]]
