Standard Enthalpy of Formation is the calculation of Enthalpy required to make 1 mole of product, reactants are balanced with fractions to equal the moles reactant.

Reactants that are at standard state have an enthalpy for formation of zero.
$Br_{2}$ is a tricky question because its standard state is a liquid and not as a diatomic gas.

# Determining Correct Standard Enthalpy of Formation

1. Check that the product is exactly one mole
2. Check if reactants are balance to make exactly one mole of product
3. Check if reactants are at correct state
