# 10.1 Bonding Models and AIDS Drugs

[[HIV-Proteases]]
[[Bonding Theories]] predit how atoms bond together to form molecules
[[Protease Inhibitors]]
[[Lewis Structures|Lewis Dot Structures]]

# 10.2 Representing Valence Electrons with Dots

[[Lewis Model]] uses [[Lewis Structures|Lewis Dot Structures]] 
[[Valence Electrons]] of [[Main Group Elements]] are represented as dots around the [[Elements]]

[[Valence Electrons]] can be deduced my [[Periodic Table of the Elements]] or [[Electron Configurations]]

Dots fill singly first

[[Duet]] are completed valence of 2 for Hydrogen and Helium

# 10.3 Lewis Structures of Ionic Compounds: Electrons 

[[Ionic Bonds]] vs [[Molecules|Molecular]] Bonds 

[[Ionic Bonds]] Move the valence dot to the other element
[[Anions]] in [[Lewis Model]] are written in brackets and charge
If single positives need to fufill 2- or higer, than add another atom to balance

# 10.4 Covalent Lewis Structures: Electrons Shared

[[Covalent Bonds]]

## Single Bonds

[[Electrons]] that are shared between the two atoms are [[Bonding Pairs]] and nonbinding pairs are [[Lone Pairs]]

[[Bonding Pairs]] are written as a line between two atoms
[[Halogens]] form [[Diatomic Elements]]

## Double Triple Bonds

Convert lone pairs when the single bond doesnt work to form a [[Double Covalent Bonds]], they are shorter and stronger than single bonds

If the double bonds weren't enough, convert another lone pair and make a [[Triple Covalent Bonds]]

# 10.5 Writing Lewis Structures for Covalent Compounds

1. Write correct skeletal structure for molecule

Correctly arrange [[Central Atoms]] and [[Terminal Atoms]]
Less [[Metals|Metallic]] [[Elements]] are [[Terminal Atoms]]
[[Halogens]] are almost always [[Terminal Atoms]]
[[Hydrogen]] are always [[Terminal Atoms]]
[[Molecules]] tend to be symmetrical

2. Calculate the total number of [[Valence Electrons]] of each atom of the molecule

[[Polyatomic Ions]]' charges should be calculated

3. Distribute electrons among atoms giving [[Octets]] to as many atoms as possible

Always start with a single bond between each pair of atoms
Distribute to terminal atoms first then the central

4. If atoms lack octet, form double or triple bonds 

## Writing Lewis Structure for Polyatomic Ions

Do the same thing as the last one but add or substract electrons relative to the necessary charge

Then make sure an octet forms with the given charge, put it in brackets and notate the charge

## Exception to the Octet Rule

NO
BF and BH

### Expanded Octets

SF_6
PCl_5

# 10.6 Resonance: Equivalent Lewis Structure for the Same Molecule

Molecules can have multiple valid lewis structures
Resonance is when double bond distribution is ambiguous and can be written in any valid position like in benzene and hexene rings.
This forms [[Resonance Structures]] 
A moleucule can make 2 lewis structures and make [[Resonance Hybrids]]

# 10.7 Predicting The Shapes of Molecules

[[Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory]] 
[[Electron Groups]] Can be lone pairs, bonds, or lone electrons
[[Electron Geometry]] is the geometrical arrangement of electron groups
[[Molecular Geometry]] is the arrangement of atoms

# 10.8 Electronegativity and Polarity: Why Oil and Water don't mix

[[Electronegativity]]
Oxygen partial negative because higher electronegativity relative to H
The uneven sharing is a [[Dipole Moments|Dipole Moments]] 
If they have [[Dipole Moments]], they are [[Polar Covalent Bonds]]
elements with identical electronegativities have no dipole moments and make [[Nonpolar Covalent Bond]]
[[Pure Covalent Bonds]] are equal in electronegativity 

## Electronegativity

The ability attract [[Electrons]] within [[Chemical Bonds]] it determined by the difference of [[Electronegativity]] between two [[Atoms]]

The greater electronegative atom typically gains a partial negative charge and can be written as $\ce{ \delta- }$. The uneven sharing is a [[Dipole Moments]]. [[Covalent Bonds]] with [[Dipole Moments]] are [[Polar Covalent Bonds]]

## Polar Bonds and Polar Molecules

[[Polar Molecules]] is one with [[Polar Covalent Bonds]] that add together and form a net [[Dipole Moments]]

[[Diatomic Molecules]] are predictable because only a different between two is calculated

Polatomic Molecules need to be calculated
Polar bonds can be notated with arrows
From postiive to negative

[[Polar Covalent Bonds]] can be represented with [[Vectors]] $\ce{ +-> }$

## Common cases of adding dipole moments to determine whether a molecule is polar

### Polar

Three polar bonds in a trigonal pyramidal arrangement will not cancel 
Two polar bonds with an angel of less than 180 will not cancel
Four identical polar bonds in a tetrahedral will no cancel

Determine if the molecule contains polar bonds (a difference in EN)
Determine whether the polar bonds add together to form a net dipole moment
If the molecule is asymmetrical, it might be polar
