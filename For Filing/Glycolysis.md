[[Glycolysis]], "splitting of sugar", is the process of breaking down [[Glucose]] in the [[Cytosol]] of [[Cells]] and converting it to two [[Pyruvate]] molecules which can go into a few pathways, but primarily goes into [[Cellular Respiration]]. One [[Glucose]] molecule can yield 2 [[Pyruvate]], 2 [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]], and 2 [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]].

[[Glycolysis]] is considered one of many [[Catabolic Pathways]] because it breaks down [[Glucose]] 

# The Inputs and Outputs of Glycolysis

[[Glucose]] $\ce{ -> }$ 2 [[Pyruvate]] + 2 $\ce{ H_{2}O }$
4 [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] - 2 [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] used $\ce{ -> }$ 2 ATP
2 [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] + 4 $\ce{ e- }$ + 4 $\ce{ H+ }$ $\ce{ -> }$ 2 [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] + 2 $\ce{ H+ }$

# The Steps of Glycolysis 

## Step 1

$$\ce{ Glucose ->[ATP->ADP][Hexokinase] Glucose 6-Phosphate }$$
The enzyme [[Hexokinase]] tacks on a [[Phosphate Groups|Phosphate Group]] to 6' of [[Glucose]] from an [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] to make it more reactive and lock the [[Monosaccharides|Monosaccharide]] into the cell.
