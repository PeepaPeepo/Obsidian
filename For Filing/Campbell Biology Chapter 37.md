# Why do plants need minerals from the soil?

Nitrogen, phosporous, patassium, and other essentials

Nitrogen is for DNA, RNA, proteins, chlorophyll

Patassium is cofactor for enzymes used throughout the cell, plays major role in maintaining turgor
Phosporous for DNA

# Concept 37.1 Soil contains a living, complex ecosystem

## Soil Horizons

[[Soil Horizons]], [[A Horizon]] known as topsoil consists of mineral particles
Living organisms and [[Humus]] is decaying oragnic material

[[B Horizon]] has less organic material
[[C Horizon]] is partially broken down rock

How Plants get minerals

Ion exhange from negatiev minerals from soil
Released CO2 creates carbonates
Vacant space attracts positive ions

## Organic Components

[[Humus]] prevents packing of clay particles, and forms a crumbly soil that retains water but allows adequate root aeration, increase cation exchange

[[Organic Components]] provides reservoir of nutrients are thatare gradually released through depcomposed

Topsoils contain a diversity of [[Organisms]] including bacteria, fungi, algae, and other prostis

Earthworms mix and clump soil particles improving gas diffusion

Soil Conservation and Sustatinable agriculture

Cultivating crops in the same location over amny seasons deplete nutrients

[[Fertilization]] is the addition of mineral nutrient to hte soil, combats this problem

Soil managment, by fertilization and other parctices allowed for sedentatra

Natural ecosystems agricultre depletes mineral content

Minsmangement of soils during american dust bowl, resulted in erosion

30% of world's farmlnad has reduce productivity

Sustainable agriculture is to use farming methods that are conservative minded,

Organic fertilizes composed of manure, fishmeal, or sompost, gradually release npk

Mintearls in commerical fertilizers are immediately availabile but may not be retained by soil for long

Results with algal blooms depleting oxygen

# Why do Plants need minerals from the soil?

[[Nitrogen]], [[Phosphorus]], and [[Potassium]] play important role in plant structure and function

[[Nitrogen]] is a component of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]
[[Proteins]]
[[Chlorophyll]]

[[Potassium]] is a [[Cofactors]] for enzymes used throughout the cell, and maintains [[Turgor]]

[[Phosphorus]] is a a component of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]
[[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] produced by [[Mitochondria]]
[[Phospholipids]] in cell membranes

# Concept 37.1 Soil Contains a living, complex ecosystem

Plants obtain their water and minerals from [[Topsoil]]
Living organisms are important in that layer
Basic physical properties of soil are texture and composition

## Soil Horizons

Stratified into layers called [[Soil Horizons]]
[[Topsoil]] contains mineral particles, living organisms, and [[Humus]] 
Separated into 3 horizons A, B and C
A being the most nutritious
C being broken rock

## Organic Components

[[Humus]] creates crumbly soil that retains water but allows root [[Aeration]], increase cation exchange
[[Organic Components]] provide nutrients released through decomposition
[[Topsoil]] contains [[Organisms]], bacteria, fungi, algae, and other protists, insects
Earth worms mix and clump soil particles and improves gas diffusion and water retention

## Soil Conversation and Sustainable Agriculture

30% of farmland has reduced productvitity
[[Sustainable Agriculture]] 
Organic fertilizers composed of manure, fishmeal, or composts gradually release NPK during [[Decomposition]]
Commerical fertilizers are immediately available but not retained by soil for long
Minerals no absorbed are leached from soil and carried aquatic ecosystems
Results in algal blooms that deplete oxygen and kill fish
