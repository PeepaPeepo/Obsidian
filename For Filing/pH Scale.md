$$\ce{ pH = -\log_{10} [H_{3}O+] }$$
$$\ce{ [H_{3}O+][OH-] = 10^{-14}}$$

To find [[Potential of Hydrogen|pH]] take the $\ce{ -\log_{10}}$ of [[Molarity]] of $\ce{ H+ }$, or $\ce{ H_{3}O+ }$.

- The pH of [[Solutions]] is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of $H^+$ [[Ions]] present
- $\ce{ H+ }$ is also substituted with [[Hydronium Ions]] $H_{3}O^+$ and appears when $H$ dissociates in water molecules
- The lower the pH is the higher concentration of [[Hydronium Ions]] which causes higher [[Acids|acidity]]
- The higher the pH the lower concentration of [[Hydronium Ions]]
- To calculate pH, enter $H_3O^+$ value to $-\log$ on scientific calculator
