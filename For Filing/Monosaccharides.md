- The [[Monomers]] of [[Carbohydrates]] [[Polymers]] are called [[Monosaccharides]]
- When two [[Monosaccharides]] are [[Covalent Bonds|covalently bonded]] they form [[Disaccharides]]
- When multiple [[Monosaccharides]] create a chain bonded by covalent bonds, they form [[Polysaccharides]]
- [[Monosaccharides]] are composed of multiples of $CH_{2}O$
- The [[Carbon]] of [[Monosaccharides]] are located between a [[Hydrogen]] and a [[Hydroxyl Groups]] 
- Sugars are classified as [[Ketoses]] or [[Aldoses]] based on the placement of the [[Carbonyl Groups]] in the compound
- Sugars are also based on the size of its [[Carbon Skeletons]]
	- [[Trioses]] are three-carbon sugars $C_{3}H_{6}O_{3}$
	- [[Pentoses]] are five-carbon sugars $C_{5}H_{10}O_{5}$ and its Aldehyde form is a component of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]
	- [[Hexoses]] are six-carbon sugars $C_{6}H_{12}O_{3}$ 
- The [[Atoms]] and [[Molecules]] surrounding [[Asymmetric Carbons]] can alter the compound
- [[Pentoses]] and [[Hexoses]] form rings due stability under physiological conditions
- Glucose are major nutrients for cells
- Involved with [[Cellular Respiration]]
- Carbon skeletons serve as material for organic molecule synthesis such as [[Amino Acids]] and [[Fatty Acids]]
