$$\ce{ Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area} }$$

The [[Pressure]] exerted by a gas sample is defined as the force per unit area that results from the collisions of gas particles with surrounding surfaces.

If a scientist halves the area of the container but doubles the amount of applied force, by what factor does the pressure change?



# Commons Units of Pressure

[[Pascal]] ([[Pascal|Pa]])
[[Atmosphere]] ([[Atmosphere|atm]])
[[Millimeter of Mercury]] ([[Millimeter of Mercury|mm Hg]])
[[Millimeter of Mercury|Torr]] ([[Millimeter of Mercury|torr]])
[[Pounds per Square Inch]] ([[Pounds per Square Inch|psi]])
[[Inches of Mercury]] ([[Inches of Mercury|In. Hg]])

$\ce{ 1 Pa = \frac{N}{m^2} }$
$\ce{ 1 atm = 101,325 pA }$
$\ce{ 1 atm = 760 mmHg }$
$\ce{ 1 mmHg = 1 torr }$
$\ce{ 1 atm = 29.92 inHg }$
$\ce{ 1 atm = 14.7 psi }$
