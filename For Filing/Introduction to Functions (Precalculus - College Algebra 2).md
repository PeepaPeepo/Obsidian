# Goals

Understand how functions operate
Composition of functions
Identify and determine if something is a function
How to evaluate functions
Takes one input to give one output?

# Definition

**A function is a relationship that maps 1 input to 1 output**
In most cases the variables are x and y
Independent Variables are typically x
Dependent variables are typically y
Domain is a set of independent variable that a user can pick
Range is a set of dependent variables that are output from independent variable
Inputs are typically x-values
outputs are y or f(x) values
**An input never gives more than 1 output**

Both x and y create an [[Ordered Pairs]]
(x, y) or (x, f(x))

## Example

Work Hours, Pay
25, 500
53, 310
30, 490
40, 490

Determine inputs and outputs
**Does every input give exactly one output**
It is okay if the input gives the same output as another input

Domain is set of inputs
Range is set of outputs
Function relationship

Input notation
Inputs: {25, 53, 30, 40}
Outputs: {500, 310, 490}

### Sample

S = {(-2,16), (-1,4), (0,3), (1,4)}
R = {(-2,5), (3,9), (5,0), (-2,6)}

Do any of the input values repeat?
Since there is no repetition, there cannot be any multiple output's of one input
S is a function
R is not a function
	-2 repeats and gives multiple outputs

Functions are naturally in algebraic formulas

y=-7x+5

You can plug in ordered pairs to determine characteristics
Simply expressions to solve for y

2x-4y=8
-4y=8-2x
y=(8-2x)/-4
y=(1/2)x-2

Looking for notation inputs that causes to outputs
Looking for anything with a +/-, it breaks the function because it provides multiple outputs

√(square root)=alt+2,5,1

y=√3-2x

The only issue is when +/- in an expression exists

y^2=x
square both sides
y=-/+√x

get all terms with y on one side and factor them
Factoring Expressions
