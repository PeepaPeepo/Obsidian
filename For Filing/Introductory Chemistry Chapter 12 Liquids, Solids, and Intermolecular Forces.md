Any state of matter in contact of another are [[Solutions]]

## Solutions

[[Solubility|Solute]] and [[Solvent]]
Component is typically a solute
[[Homogenous]] and [[Heterogenous]] [[Mixtures]]
[[Homogenous]] can be any states of matter
[[Solubility|Solute]] is a lower amount relative to [[Solvent]]

Exceptions include [[Aqueous Solutions]]
Dissolution of $\ce{ NaCl }$ $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ 

Solute Solute interactions
Solvent Solvent Interactions
[[Systems]] go to a point of lower energy
 Like dissolves like
 Nonpolar-nonpolar
 polar-polar
 etc

[[Saturation Points]], [[Saturation Points|Saturation]] and [[Saturation Points|Unsaturation]] and [[Saturation Points|Super Saturation]]

$\ce{ NaCl }$ saturation point is 
Every substance has different saturation characteristics

Saltwater or sugar and add sugar until fully saturated at room temp
Then Heat up until super saturated
Put a chopstick in the cooled super saturated solution
"Crashes out"
[[Recrystallization]]

 [[Receptors]] on tongue have [[Lock and Key Fit]] and other mechanisms to signal tongue
[[Intermolecular Forces]] exists between molecules and not within
Water has spherical shape
Influences [[States of Matter]]
[[Thermal Energy]]
[[Atoms]] and [[Molecules]] are constantly moving
solids have stronger imf
liquids are medium
gas have much less
[[Crystalline]] vs [[Amorphous]] structures
imf is the very existence of liquids and solids
everything would be gaseous
liquids includes surface tension and viscosity
Origin of surface tension
Interior molecules interact with six neighbhors
but surface moleultes interact with four neighbors
every substance has inherent intermolecular forces
Water drops are spherical because of attractive forces pulling into eitself
maple syrum is viscous
Viscousity have lower imfs and hinders flow
long molecules such as hydrocarbons in motor oil tned to form viscous liquids because molecular entaglement

Evaporation, condensiation, and thermal energy

vaporation increases with increasing surface area, increasing temperature, decreaasing strength of imf, 
easy evaporation is [[Volatile]] and the opposite is [[Volatile|nonvolatile]]
[[Evaporation]] 

because the surface of a liquid are held less tighlty than the interior, it can evaporate
[[Condensation]] 
[[Dynamic Equilibrium]] rate of evaporation = rate of condensation

[[Vapor Pressure]] increases with temperature, decreasing strenght of imf
Independent of surface area 
[[Boiling]] thermal energy is enough to break intermolecular forces of substances of interior molecules and form gaseous water molecules

# 12.1 Spherical Water

[[Intermolecular Forces]] exists between all [[Particles]] that compose [[Matter]]
It is responsible for states of matter
[[Atoms]] and [[Molecules]] are in constant random motion, the energy is [[Thermal Energy]]
Stronger [[Intermolecular Forces]] will likely form [[Liquids]] or [[Solids]]

# 12.2 Properties of Liquids and Solids

[[Solids]] may be [[Crystalline]] or [[Amorphous]]

# 12.3 Intermolecular Forces in Action: Surface Tension and Viscosity

## Surface Tension

[[Surface Tension]] is the tendency of liquids to minimize their surface area
This characteristic tends to resist penetration
Water's surface area needs to increase to allow matter to pass
increase is resisted because molucles at the surface interact with less than interior
Liquids tend to minimize the number of molecules at the surface
Surface tension increase with increasing imf

## Viscosity

[[Viscosity]] is the resistance of liquid to flow
It is more apparaent with liquids with higher imf
Long molecules such as hydrocarbons do that because of molecular entangle ment

# 12.4 Evaporation and Condensation

[[Distribution of Kinetic Energy]], at any given moment some molecules in the liquid are moving faster than average and some are slower
some have enough energy to break from surface to cause [[Evaporation]] or [[Vaporization]]
Transition between liquid to gaseous state
Rate of vaporization increases with Increasing surface area, increasing temperature, and decreasing strength of intermolecular forces
[[Volatile]] liquids evaporate easily
[[Nonvolatile]] do not
[[Condensation]] is the transition of gas to liquid
Rate of condensation and evaporation is equal is [[Dynamic Equilibrium]]
[[Vapor Pressure]] of a liquid is the partial pressure of its vapor in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid 
It increases with increasing temperature and decreasing strength of IMF

## Boiling

[[Boiling Point]] is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the pressure above it
Mixture of boiling water and steam always has a temperature of 100 C at 1 atm pressure

## Energetics of Evaporation and Condensation

Evaporation is [[Endothermic Reactions|Endothermic]]

## Heat of Vaporization

[[Heat of Vaporization]] is the heat required to vaporize one mol of liquid

# 12.5 Melting, Freezing, and Sublimation

[[Melting Point]] is when atoms and molecules can overcome their imf that holds them solid

## Energetics of Melting and Freezing

## Heat of Fusion

[[Heat of Fusion]] is the amount of heat required to melt 1 mol of solid

## Sublimation

[[Sublimation]] is when a substance changes from solid state directly to gaseous state

# 12.6 Types of Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion, Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding, Ion Dipole

# Dispersion Force 

[[London Dispersion Forces|Dispersion Forces]] caused by fluctuations in electron distribution within molecules or atoms
Fleeting charge separation is [[Instantaneous Dipole]]
Transient
Depends how easily the electrons in atom or molecule move or polrize
Depends on electron cloud
Larger clouds allow greater force because electrons are held less tightly
It increases with increasing molar mass
increases boiling poitn as well
[[Polarize]] means to form a dipole moment

## Dipole Dipole Forces

[[Dipole Moments|Dipole-Dipole Forces]] exists in all polar molucles
They have [[Permanent Dipoles]]
Higher melting points
[[Miscibility]] is the ability to mix without separating into two phases
Polar liquids are miscible with other polar liquirds

## Hydrogen Bonding

[[Polar Molecules]] contains hydrogen bonded to [[Fluorine]], [[Oxygen]], or [[Nitrogen]] or ONF
Its a super dipole
greater difference in EN
Hydrogen bonds have 2 to 5% strenght of a covalent bond

## Ion Dipole Force

[[Ion Dipole Forces]] occurs in mixtures of ionic compounds and polar compounds
Aqueous soltuions of ionic compounds
It is the strongest force of the four types
Formation of hydration shell

# 12.7 Types of Crystalline Solids: Molecular, Ionic, and Atomic

[[Amorphous]]
[[Crystalline]] can be [[Molecules|Molecular]], [[Ionic Bonds|Ionic]], or [[Atoms|Atomic]]

## Molecular Solids

[[Molecular Solids]] where composite units are molecules like H2O
It is held by dispersion, dipole, and hyrodgen bonding

## Ionic Solids

[[Ionic Solids]] are solids where composite units are [[Formula Units]], they are formed with [[Ionic Bonds]]
They have high melting points

## Atomic Solids

[[Atomic Solids]] only are made of atoms of a unit liek diamonds and iron
it ca nbe split in into three types

[[Covalent Atomic Solids]] held by covalent bonds
[[Nonbonding Atomic Solids]] held by dispersion forces
[[Metallic Atomic Solids]] held by metallic bonds consists of postively charged ions in a see of electrons, varies based on metals 
Consists of metal cations in a negatively charged setting
