[[Aquatic Biomes]] are characterized by physical and chemical [[Environments]]
Factors include [[Salinity]]
Oceans make up the largest marine biome
Covers 75% of earth's surface
Water evaporates from oceans provide the rainfall
Marine Algae and photosynthetic bacteria supply much of the worlds oxygen and consume large amounts of atmospheric CO2
Tends to moderate terrestrial lands

# Zonation in Aquatic Biomes

[[Aquatic Biomes]] are physically and chemically stratified
[[Photic Zone]] is the region that has sufficient light for [[Photosynthesis]]
[[Aphotic Zone]] have little light
Both of the photic and Aphotic zones make up the [[Pelagic Zone]]
Deep in Aphotic zone is the [[Abyssal Zone]] 
[[Benthic Zone]] is the floor, organic and inorganic sediment, and [[Benthos]]
[[Benthos]] is the organisms that occupy the [[Benthic Zone]]
	Primary food is [[Detritus]]
[[Sunlight]] warms the [[Pelagic Zone]] and provides energy for [[Photosynthesis]]
The change in temperature in bodies of water is called [[Thermocline]] that separates warm and cool water
[[Turnover]] sends oxygenated water to the bottom, and nutrient rich water rises during spring and fall.
