		[[Cephalization]] is the formation of brain
	[[Radial Symmetry]]
	[[Asymmetry]] include sponges and coral
Tissues and Germ Layers
	[[Parazoa]] lack tissues, and are simple. They are sponges in [[Porifera]]
	[[Metazoa]] are complex, special organ
	[[Diploblasty]] is a form of germ layer developemnt, there is an endo and ectoderm
		All Radial animals are diplos
	[[Triploblasty]] has three layers where Mesoderms
		Bilateral organisms are tripblasts 
Coelom
	Presences of it determines animal
	Only applys to tripo blasts
	You ahve it, dont have it, or kinda dont have it separated
Embryonic Development
	Blastopore becomes a mouth or anus
	Only occurs in [[Coelomates]]
	Either [[Proteosomes]] or [[Deuterostome]] 
	Deuterostome is where it makes an anus where a DUECE comes out
Digestive Tract
	[[Incomplete Digestive Tract]]
		No anus
	[[Complete Digestive Tract]]
		One way
		[[Alimentary Canal]]
Reproduction
	[[Asexual Reproduction]] one parent
		Budding
		Fragmentation
