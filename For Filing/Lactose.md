![[Lactose Structural Formula.png]]

[[Lactose]] is a [[Disaccharides|Disaccharide]] composed of [[Glucose|D-Glucose]] [[Monomers]] and a [[Galactose|D-Galactose]] [[Monomers]], and have a $\beta$ 1' - 4' [[Glycosidic Linkages]] between them, the bond is directed upwards from the D-Glucose's [[Anomeric Carbons|Anomeric Carbon]]. The natural synthesis of lactose occurs in [[Mammals|Mammary]] [[Tissues]].  The [[Hydroxyl Groups]] connected to D-Galactose's Anomeric Carbon seems to be in the $\alpha$ position[^1].
