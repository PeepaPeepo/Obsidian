## DNA Isolation

- Extraction and purification of genomic DNA
- Buffers
- Spin Column
- Cells
- Cheek cells
- Polymerase chain reaction
- Measured with spectrophotmeter
	- NanoDrop 2000
	- Quantifies DNA
	- 260/280 ratio 1.8 is very pure

## Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR

- Amplify small amounts of DNA to generate More
- Trace amounts of DNA needed to make copies
- Use forward and reverse primers
- DNA that goes through the process is referred to as a template DNA
- Threshold for PCR Template DNA must be combined with of master mix, primers, and ultra pure water
- Volume of DNA should be calculated on concentration
- 10 uL 
- Incubate with thermo cycler
- Genomic DNA, referred to as Nuclear DNA
- 23 pairs of chromosomes, for 46 total
- one chromosome was inherited from each parent
- [[Chromosomes]] is made up of DNA helix around histone proteins
- DNA length differs between chromosomes
- Genotype depends on gene being studied
- protein coding [[Genes]] is a portion of DNA sequence
- 20,000 genes are protein coding genes
- Amplify the TH01 non-coding gene which is located on chromosome 11 
- Every gene can have many alleles or variations of itself

### Part 3A: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Non-Digested PCR Samples

- Measure out 0.5 g of agarose powder
- Add to 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask
	- This is for 1% solution meant for non-digested DNA
- 600 mL beaker combine 10 mL of 50X TAE buffer and 490 mL of deionized water, it will make 500 mL of 1X TAE buffer
- Add 50 mL of newly made 1X TAE buffer into flask containing agarose powder to make 1% agarose gel solution
- Place flask into microwave to heat for 60 seconds
	- Swirl every 30 seconds
	- Add 3 uL of GelRed Prior to pouring
- Setup casting tray, insert a well comb in the left slot, attach barriers, pour until 0.5 cm is achieved
- When cooled remove comb and barriers
- Place gel into casting tray and in the gel box
- add [[1X TAE Buffer]] to both of the bilateral reservoirs until gel is submerged
- Using p20 Micropipette, add 5 uL of loading dye to piece of Parafilm, add 5 uL of pcr product
	- loading dye is brightly colored
- Using p20 Micropipette, pipette 10 uL of colored PCR product into an empty well
- On fresh piece of para film, combine 
	- 5 uL of [[Molecular Weight Marker]] (MWM)
	- 2 uL of Loading Dye
	- 3 uL of 1X TAE
- Using p20, move 10 uL of sample into an empty well
- Assemble the gel electrophoresis box
- Run gel for 45 minutes at 100 V
- When dye moves about 3/4 of the way of the gel, turn off the voltage source
- Take photograph of the agarose gel via ChemiDoc and Image Lab Software

### Part 3B: [[Restriction Enzyme Digestion]] of PCR Products

1. Into PCR product tube, add the following [[Reagents]]
	1. 2 uL [[Cut-Smart Buffer]]
	2. 1 uL of the enzyme specific for your genotype screening
2. Place labelled PCR product tube into a thermocycler/PCR machine. Most machines will incubate for 2 hours at 37 ^oC
3. For screening of lactose intolerance, samples must be incubated for two hours at 65 oC
4. Restriction enzme will iniate cutting if applicable to your SNP variation
5. Depending on genotype, DNA will either be cut or not cut
6. Include this incubation temperature in your lab report
7. Any agarose gels prepare after an RE digest should be 2% gels
