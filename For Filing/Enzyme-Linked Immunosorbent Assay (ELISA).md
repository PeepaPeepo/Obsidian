[[Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)]] is a technique to detect and quantify [[Peptides]], [[Proteins]], [[Enzymatic Proteins|Enzymes]], [[Antigens]], [[Antibodies]], or [[Hormones]].

[[Polyclonal]]

# Materials and Methods

## Part 1: ELISA Protocol

10/19/2023

Acquired [[96-Well Plate]] labelled the wells as the following: 

	Wells 1 - 3 Postive +
	Wells 4 - 6 Negative -
	Wells 7 - 9 Patient A Sample
	Wells 10 - 12 Patient B Sample

Using a p200, transferred 50 uL of positive sample into Wells 1 - 3, and 50 uL of negative sample into Wells 4-6.

Transferred 50 uL of Patient Sample A to Wells 7 - 9. Transferred 50 uL of Patient Sample B to wells 10 -12.

Incubated samples at room temperature for 5 minutes. Removed the excess onto paper towels while avoiding backsplash. Using a p200, added 50 uL of wash buffer into each well and removed excess. Repeated once more for a total of 2 rinses.

Using a p200, transferred 50 uL of primary antibody, [[Rabbit Anti-Chicken Polyclonal Antibody]], in each well. Incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. 

Removed the excess onto paper towels while avoiding backsplash. Using a p200, added 50 uL of wash buffer into each well and removed excess. Repeated once more for a total of 2 rinses.
