[[Brønsted Lowry Acid and Bases|Bronsted Lowry Acid and Bases]] applies to wider range of acid base phenomena
Focuses on transfer of H+

[[Brønsted Lowry Acid and Bases|Bronsted Lowry Acid and Bases]] Acids are proton H+ Donor
Bases are proton H+ Acceptor

# 14.5 Reactions of Acid and Bases

## Neutralization Reactions

[[Acid-Base Reactions|Neutralization Reactions]] generally form water and a salt, an [[Ionic Compounds]] which remains dissolved in the solution

[[Net Ionic Equations]] for [[Acid-Base Reactions|Neutralization Reactions]] are
$\ce{ H+(aq) + OH- (aq) -> H_{2}O (l) }$

Reactions wiht carbonates or bicarbonates, componds that contain CO3^2- or HCO3^-
This are also [[Gas Evolution Reactions]]

[[Titration]], reacting substance in a solution of known concentration with another substance in a solution of unknown concentration

[[Equivalence Points]] are points where stoichiometric equal amounts are met

# 14.7 Strong and Weak Acid and Bases

## Strong Acids

$\ce{ HCl }$ is a one type of [[Strong Acids]], and they completely ionize in solution
Complete ionization of HCl with a single arrow pointing to the right

[[Strong Acids]] are also [[Strong Electrolytes]], a substance whose aqueous solutions are good conductors of electricity

[[Monoprotic Acids]] contain one ionizable proton
[[Diprotic Acid]] contains two ionizable protons

## Weak Acids

[[Weak Acids]] does not completely ionize in solution
Double arrows indicate partial ionization

$\ce{ HF(aq) + H_{2}O(l) <=> H_{3}O+(aq) + F-(aq) }$

[[Weak Acids]] are also [[Weak Electrolytes]], a substance whose aqueous solutions are poor conductors of electricity

Degree which strong or weak acids are determined are based on attraction of anion of acid and hydrogen ion.

[[Strong Acids]], attraction between H+ and A- is low, resulting in complete ionization
Weak acids, attraction between H+ and A- is high, resulting in partial ionization

The stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base and vice versa

## Strong Bases

[[Strong Bases]] compeltely dissociates in solution

$\ce{ NaOH(aq -> Na+(aq) + OH-(aq) }$

[[Weak Bases]] most comon weak bases produce $\ce{ OH- }$ by accepting a proton from water, ionizing water to form $\ce{ OH- }$

Double arrows indicate ionization is not complete

# 14.8 Water: Acid and Base in One

[[Water]] is [[Amphoteric Substances]]

$\ce{ [H_{3}O+] = [OH-] = 1.0*10^{-7} M }$
[[Ion Product Constant]] is $K_{W}$
$\ce{ K_{W} = [H_{3}O+][OH-] }$

Concentration of H3O+ times the concentration of OH- is 1.1x10^-14
[[Acidic Sollution]] contains an acid that creates additional H_3O+ ions cuasing H3O+ to increase 

Basic solutions create additonal OH- Ions

# 14.9 The pH and pOH Scales: Ways to express acidity and Basicity

[[pH Scale]] is based on hydrogen ion concentration to express acidity or basicity of solutions

$\ce{ pH < 7 = Acidic }$
$\ce{ pH > 7 = basic }$
$\ce{ pH = 7 = Neutral }$

[[pH Scale]] is [[Logarithmic Scale]], a change of 1 pH unit corresponds to a tenfold change in H3O+ concentration

## Calculating pH from $\ce{ [H_{3}O+] }$

$\ce{ pH = -\log[H_{3}O+] }$

$\ce{ -\log(1.5*10^{-7}) = 6.82 }$

pH is reported to two decimal places because only the numbers to the right of the decimal place are significan in a log

If the original number has three sig fis, report the log to three decimals

original sigfig = number of decimal places

## Calculating $\ce{ [H_{3}O+] }$ from pH

log can be undonw using inverse log function using the $\ce{ 10^x }$ key

$\ce{ pH = -\log[H_{3}O+] }$
$\ce{ -pH = \log[H_{3}O+] }$
$\ce{ 10^{-pH} = 10^{\log[H_{3}O+]} }$
$\ce{ 10^{-pH} = [H_{3}O] }$
