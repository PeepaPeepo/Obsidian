- Midterm and Finals have study guides
- Poster session that is like a lab report

# Lab Reports

- Turned in via Canvas
- Introductions
- Material/Methods. Results

- Reference rubric

First 09/07 Lab
Gene Screen
- DNA isolation
- Picking DNA traits for experiment
- CHRISPR
	- Bacteria immune system
	- Gene editing

# Micro Pipette

- Do the worksheet esp the one in red 
	- Don't do 1 -21
- DO MATH LAB

Access Manual Via orange doc
Student opinion on 
- P20
- p200
- p1000 typically blue 1ml

# Practice Agarose Gel Electrophoresis

- Read protocols before coming to class
- Add PCR to gel and itll move a
- will give genotype

# Gene Screen

- Understand micropipetting

Techniques

- DNA Isolation
	- NanoDrop 2000
		- One type of spectrophotometer
		- This instrument can quantify DNA concentration
			- measures light that passes thorugh the sample
			- 
	- A Process which inovles extracion and purifcation of DNA
	- Works with genomic, mitochondrial, and viral DNA
	- Materials include various buffers, a spin. columnm collection tubes, and a DNA sample
		- The protol varies depending on the type of sample
	- account about 1 hour to 2 hours
- Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR
	- Technique used to amplify small amounts of DNA and generate exponetially larger amounts of DNA
- Restriction Enyzem Digetst
	- Not required for all genetic screenings
- Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
- Intermediate Steps
- DNA Sequences

Fluorescent DNA Stains

- GelRed^tm

DNA is negatively charged
Gel Imaging

- ChemiDoc imaing system can be used to visualiize and photograph the completed gel
- UV transilluminator can be used

- Lab manual teaches techniques that can be used in jobs

non-digested vs digested pcr products

# Lab Manual Not doing

- Crime scene DNA
- Subculture

# Bold Terms are on tests

- Follow study guide to suceed

Are there other PCR result figures for other traits we can reference?

Let Jennifer know about traits your are interested in

Look for Genetic Mutation paper
and a rs number to go with it
