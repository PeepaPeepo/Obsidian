# Solubility Rules

Specific [[Anions]] are mostly soluble.

# Writing Equation for Precipitation Reactions 

That cation from one compound can now pair with from the other compound to form new and potentially insoluble products

# Writing Equations for Precipitation Reactions

Combine the cation from one reactant with the anion from the other. Make sure to write neutral charge compounds for the new ionic compounds. 

Solubility rules determine whether any of the potential new products are insoluble. 

Reactants maintain their original charges before reaction.

# 7.1 Grade School Volcanoes, Automobiles, and Laundry Detergents

[[Chemical Reactions]] are transformations of substances through the making and breaking of [[Chemical Bonds]]. Baking soda and [[Acetic Acid]] react and form to form [[Carbon Dioxide]], water, and sodium acetate.

[[Gas Evolution Reactions]] are reactions that occur in liquids and form gases. 

[[Combustion Reactions]] are a subset of [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]] and happens commonly in car engines. [[Hydrocarbons]] such as [[Octane]] $\ce{ C_{8}H_{18} }$ combines with oxygen and forms carbon dioxide and water.

[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions]] is caused by electron transference between [[Substances]].

Laundry detergents contains substances that softens hard water.

Reactions that form solid substances are called [[Precipitation Reactions]]

# 7.2 Evidence of a Chemical Reaction

[[Chemical Reactions]] can have visual changes in [[Substances]], such as color change, formation of solids, or formation of gases.

[[Heat Absorptions]], [[Emissions]], and [[Light Emissions]] are evidences of reactions. Not all visual changes are definitive evidence. 

# 7.3 The Chemical Equation

[[Chemical Equations]] represent [[Chemical Reactions]] of [[Substances]].

$\ce{ CH_{4} + O_{2} -> CO_{2} + H_{2}O }$

Substances on the left are [[Reactants]] and substances on the right are [[Products]]. [[States of Matter]] of reacts and products are notated as g, l, s, and aq. 

[[Balanced Equations]] have equal numbers of each type of atom on both sides of the equation, and insert only coefficients and not subscripts.

# 7.4 How to write balanced chemical equations

Only change [[Coefficients]] to balance [[Chemical Equations]] and never change the [[Subscripts]] because it changes the actual composition of compounds.

Write the unbalanced equation by writing chemical formulas. 

$\ce{ SiO_{2}(s) + C(s) -> SiC(s) + CO(g) }$

$\ce{ SiO_{2}(s) + 3C(s) -> SiC(s) + 2CO(g) }$

If an [[Elements]] occurs in only one compound in both sides of the [[Chemical Equations]], balance it first. If there is more than one such element, balance [[Metals]] before [[Nonmetals]].

Begin with balance Si because it is a metal.
Balance O next
If an element occurs as a free element on either side of the chemical equation balance it last
If balanced equations contains coefficient fractions, change these into whole numbers by multiplying the entire equation by the appropriate factor. 

$\ce{ C_{8}H_{18}(l) + O_{2} (g) -> CO_{2}(g) + H_{2}O(l)  }$

$\ce{ C_{8}H_{18}(l) + O_{2} (g) -> 8CO_{2}(g) + 9H_{2}O(l)  }$

Write [[Unbalanced Equation]] first.

If an element occurs in only one compound on both sides of the equation, balance first, if there is more than one such element, balance metals before not metals.

If a free element occurs, balance it last. $\ce{ O_{2} }$ is the free element

$\ce{ O_{2} }$ can be written as 25/2 O and balanced later.
Take the denominator of the fractional coefficient and cancel and distribute to rest of the equation. 

$\ce{ C_{8}H_{18}(l) + \frac{25}{2}O_{2} (g) -> 8CO_{2}(g) + 9H_{2}O(l)  }$

$\ce{ 2\left( C_{8}H_{18}(l) + \frac{25}{2}O_{2} (g) -> 8CO_{2}(g) + 9H_{2}O(l) \right)  }$

## Skill Builder 7.3

$\ce{ C_{4}H_{10}(g) + O_{2}(g) -> CO_{2}(g) + H_{2}O (g) }$

$\ce{ 2C_{4}H_{10}(g) + 13O_{2}(g) -> 8CO_{2}(g) + 10H_{2}O (g) }$

## Example 7.4 Balancing Chemical Equations

Write a balanced equation for the reaction of solid aluminum with aqueous sulfuric acid to form aqueous aluminum sulfate and hydrogen gas.

$$\ce{ Al(s) + H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> Al_{2}(SO_{4})_3(aq) + H_{2}(g) }$$

Sulfuric Acid is a combination of Sulfate and Hydrogen, balance charges between H and SO4 to make the acid. Sulfuric should be a poly atomic ion. 

The products of this reaction need to be balanced.

Aluminum and Hydrogen are free elements in this equation show they will be balanced.
Elements that are solo in the equation are balanced last.
Sulfate is a polyatomic ion that needs to stay intact. Balance [[Polyatomic Ions]] as units. 
There are $\ce{ 3SO_{4}^2- }$ in the products, that will be used to balance the reactants.

$$\ce{ Al(s) + 3H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> Al_{2}(SO_{4})_3(aq) + H_{2}(g) }$$
Balance most metallic next.

$$\ce{ 2Al(s) + 3H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> Al_{2}(SO_{4})_3(aq) + H_{2}(g) }$$

Balance the next free Element which is H

$$\ce{ 2Al(s) + 3H_{2}SO_{4}(aq) -> Al_{2}(SO_{4})_3(aq) + 3H_{2}(g) }$$
[[Acetic Acid]]

# 7.5 Aqueous Solutions and Solubility: Compounds Dissolved in Water

[[Aqueous Solutions]] are [[Homogenous]] [[Mixtures]] of [[Substances]] with [[Water]]. [[Ionic Compounds]] such as $NaCl$ dissociate into component ions. 

$NaCl$ solutions conduct electricity. [[Substances]] that completely disassociate in solution are called [[Strong Electrolytes]] and they produce [[Strong Electrolyte Solutions]]. $AgNO_{3}$ are [[Strong Electrolytes]] because they disassociate as $Ag$ and $NO_{3}$

[[Complete Ionic Equations]] show reactants and products as they are actually present in a solution. Only aqueous ionic solutions are separated in [[Complete Ionic Equations]]

Unchanged ions in [[Complete Ionic Equations]] are known as [[Spectator Ions]] because they do not participate in Reactions. 

Spectator ions can be omitted. 

[[Net Ionic Equations]] remove [[Spectator Ions]] within [[Complete Ionic Equations]]

## Gas Evolutions Reactions

Some gas evolutions reactions form a gaseous product directly when the cation of one reactant reacts with the anion of another.

Many [[Gas Evolution Reactions]] are also [[Acid-Base Reactions]]. 
Intermediate products such as $\ce{ H_{2}CO_{3} }$ is not stable and decomposes to form $\ce{ H_{2}O }$
