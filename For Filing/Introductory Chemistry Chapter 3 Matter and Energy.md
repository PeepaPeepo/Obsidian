- During [[Chemical Changes]], matter's composition changes
	- Happens when chemicals undergo a [[Chemical Reactions]]
		- Substances present before the chemical change are called [[Reactants]]
		- Substances that are present after are called [[Products]]

$$\ce{Reactants -> Products}$$

- Arrows indicate a chemical change or reaction
- State changes are always physical changes
- Only chemical examination of substances before and after can verify which change happened
- Chemical reactions often evidenced by heat exchange or color changes
- Main difference is related to changes at molecular and atomic level
- Chemical change results in completely new substance
- Ignition cause butane to react with oxygen molecules to create carbon dioxide and water

## Separating Mixtures Through Physical Change

# 3.9 Energy and Chemical and Physical Change

Distinguish between exothermic and endothermic reactions.

- Physical and chemical changes are accompanied by energy changes
- In the context of Energy Transfer
	- Object of study is known as the [[Systems]]
	- Then exchanges energy with its surroundings
- Systems with high potential energy have a tendency to change in a way that lowers their potential energy
- Objects or systems with high potential energy tend to be unstable
- Some chemical substances are like a raised weight
- Molecules in TNT ([[Trinitrotoluene]]) have high potential energy
	- TNT Molecules tend to undergo rapid chemical change that lowers potential energy
	- Chemical reactions that release energy are [[Exothermic Reactions]]
	- [[Unstable]] 
	- Does TNT want to break apart?
		- They want to release their energy to their surroundings
- Some chemicals absorb energy from their surroundings and are know as [[Endothermic Reactions]]
- Chemical cold packs want to absorb heat from the surroundings
- Exothermic reaction have greater energy than products, and energy is released
- Endothermic reaction products have more energy that the reactants, and energy is absorbed as the reaction occurs

# 3.10 Temperature: Random Motion of Molecules and Atoms 

Convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales.

- Atoms and molecules that compose matter are in constant motion
- They contain [[Thermal Energy]]
- The hotter an object, the greater random motion of the atoms and molecules
- [[Heat]] is different from temperature
- Heat has units of energy
- Temperature is a measure of thermal energy
- [[Fahrenheit Scale]] was initially set up by assigning 0 F to the freezing point of a concentrated saltwater solution
	- Salt water solution freeze at 0 F
	- Water freeze at 32 F
	- Room Temp 72 F
	- Body Temperature 96.6 F
	- Water boil at 212 F
- Scientists use [[Celsius Scale]]
	- Water freeze at 0 C
	- Room temperature at 22 C
	- Water boil at 100 C
- Both scales contain negative temperature
- [[Kelvin Scale]]
	- 0 K is the coldest temperature possible, [[Absolute Zero]]
		- The temperature that molecular motion virtually stops
- Conversion Formulas
- How did they create the temperature scales?

$$K\ = {}^{o}C\ +\ 273.15$$
$$^{o}C\ = \frac{{}^{o}F\ - 32}{1.8}$$

- Degree symbol is not used with Kelvin Scale

# 3.11 Temperature Changes: Heat Capacity

Relate energy, temperature change, and heat capacity.

- All substances change temperature when they are heated
- How much they change given amount of heat is different
- It takes more energy to heat more matter
- Water has a higher [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
	- Expressed in grams
	- $J/g*^oC$
		- 1 gram per 1 celcius
	- [[Heat Capacity]] is a given substance
	- It takes more heat to change its temperature
	- 
	- Quantity of heat (in joules) requried to change the temperature of 1g of the substance by $1^oC$
	- Specific heat capacity has units of joules per gram per degree celsius ($J/g\ * ^oC$)

![[Pasted image 20230904155910.png]]

- Coastal cities have cooler temperatures due to the oceans or lakes thermal capacity

# 3.12 Energy and Heat Capacity Calculations

Perform calculations involving transfer of heat and changes in temperature.

- when substance absorbs heat which is represented with $q$
- its temperature change ($\Delta T$) is in direct proportion to the amount of heat absorbed.

$$\overrightarrow q\; {System\over \Delta T}$$

- The more heat absorbed, the greater the temperature change
- Use specific heat capacity of the substance to quantify the relationship between the amount of heat to a given amount of substance

$$heat\ =\ mass\ *\ specific\ heat\ capicity *\ temperature\ change$$

$$q = m * C * \Delta T$$
$$q = m * C_{s} * \Delta T$$

- $\Delta T$ in $C^o$ is equal to $\Delta T$ in $K$, but not equal to $\Delta T$ in $^oF$

- $q$ is the amount of heat in joules
- $m$ is the mass of substance in grams
- $C$ is specific heat capacity in joules per gram per degree Celsius
- $\Delta T$ is the temperature change in Celsius
- $\Delta$ means *the change in*
- $\Delta T$ means the change in temperature
- $\Delta T = T_{f}-T_{i}$
	- Difference between initial and final temperature
- $Q_c=-Q_h$
- Critical to substitute each of the correct variables into the equations with proper cancels


# Gallium Sample Problem

heat = mass * C * delta T

$q = 2.5 g * 0.372 J/(g*C) * (29.9-25.0)$
$4.557 = 2.5 g * 0.372 J/(g*C) * (29.9-25.0)$
$$\ce{ \frac{0.372 J}{(g*^oC)}*(29.29 - 25.0) }$$
$$\ce{ \Delta H_{fus} = \frac{Q}{n} }$$
"The heat of fusion is **the quantity of heat necessary to change 1 g of a solid to a liquid with no temperature change**"
