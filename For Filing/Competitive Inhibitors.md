[[Competitive Inhibitors]] are [[Molecules]] that mimic target [[Substrates]] of [[Enzymes]] and bind to [[Active Sites]] to inhibit the function of said [[Enzymes]]. It is not a 1:1 copy of the [[Substrates]], otherwise it would just be the actual [[Substrates]].

[[Competitive Inhibitors]] can be outnumbered by target [[Substrates]] and detach accordingly to put the [[Enzymes]] back to [[Work]].

[[Competitive Inhibitors]] have same $\ce{ V_{max} }$ and different $\ce{ K_{m} }$
