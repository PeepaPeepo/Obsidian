- Carbon skeletons are formed by [[Carbon Chains]]
- They can be straight, branched, or even looped into rings
- Some double bonds of a carbon chain can vary and affect the form and function of a molecule
- They are the basis for [[Organic Molecules]]; [[Elements|Elements]] from [[CHONPS]] attach as [[Molecules|molecules]] or [[Compounds|compounds]] to [[Carbon Skeletons]]
- Carbon skeleton rings can either be [[Benzene]] or [[Cyclohexane]]
	- Bezene Rings include alternating single and double bonds with six carbons
	- Cyclohexane rings are all six single bonded carbons
