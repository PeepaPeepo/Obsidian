## Objective

- Use spot tests to identify some common anions present in an unknown sample
- Idea is to add something that will react visibility with the species we are testing for
- Need 3 samples
	- negative 
	- positive
	- negative

# Experiment

- Each ion will have 3 runs
	1. +Control 1.0 ml known + reagent
	2. -Control: 1.0 ml d.H2O + Reagent
	3. unknown: 1.0 ml unknown + reagent
- Test for carbonate CO_3^2-
	- 6 M Hcl
	- Bubbling/effervesncen
	- 2H+aq + CO_3^2-
- Test for Sulfate SO_4^2-
	- 6 M Hcl, 1 M BaCl_2
	- White precipitate
- Thiocyanate SCN^-
	- $6 M HOAc, 0.1 M Fe(NO_3)_3$
	- Deep Red Color
- Halides, Cl^-
	- Reagents 6 M HNO_3, 0.1 M AgNO_3
		- White Precipitate
		- Add mL of $6M\ HNO_3$ and mix
		- Add 2-3 Drops of 0.1 M $\ce{ AgNo_3 }$
- Test for Phosphates, PO_4^3-
	- 6 M HNO _3, 0.5 M (NH_4)_2MoO_4
	- Yellow Precipitate
	- add 1 mL of 6 M HNO_3 and mix
	- 1 mL of 0.5 M (NH_4)_2MoO_4
	- If needed place test tube in hot water bath and continue to stir
- Test for Acetates, CH_3COO^-
	- 6 M HNO_3, 6 M NH_4 OH, 0.1 M KI_3, 0.1 M La(NO_3)_3
	- Dark Blue - Black Color
	- Place ripped litmus paper on watch plated
	- Transfer drop of substance via stirring rod
- Test for Nitrates, NO_3^-
	- 6 M NaOH, Al Metal 
	- NH_3 gas (turn red litmus to blue)
	- Add 1 mL 6M HNO_3 and Mix
	- Add few grains of Al, little at a time until reaction occurs
	- Hold piece of paper in side of tube not touching
- Unknown has 3 anions
	- write observations
