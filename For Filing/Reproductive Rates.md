Ignores males and concentrate on female [[Individuals]]
Females giving rise to new females
Can be measured with [[Mark-Recapture Method]], molecular tools

PCR Sampling

Developing a Database
	DNA extraction from skin samples
	Short tandem repeats at 14 loci are amplified
	Genetic profile is determined for each turtle
Comparing Samples
	PCR of skin cells
	Genetic profiles are cross referenced with database

Output measured in sexual organisms are measured as average number of female offspring produced by the females in given age group
