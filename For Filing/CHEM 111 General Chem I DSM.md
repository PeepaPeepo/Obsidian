# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW RECIPROCALS

The maximum value of V is **100**.

Because the vertical axis (1/V) is a reciprocal, the maximum value of V is where 1/V crosses the vertical axis or its intercept. The 1/V-intercept of the graph shown is 0.01. Because it is a reciprocal, the value of V is 1/0.01 = 100.

# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ROUNDING TO SIG FIGURES

To round off 1179 °C to two significant figures, drop the last two digits, 79. Because the first digit dropped is 5 or greater, the last retained digit is increased by 1 to give **1200 °C**.

Both 1180 °C and 1170 °C contain three significant figures whereas 1000 °C contains one significant figure.
