When three [[Fatty Acids]] form [[Ester Linkages]] with a single [[Glycerol|Glycerol]] it forms a [[Fats|Triglycerides]], or [[Fats|Fat]]. It is a long [[Carbon Skeletons|Carbon Skeleton]] containing about 16 - 18 carbons with the terminal carbon part of $\ce{ - COOH }$, [[Carboxyl Groups]]. The presence of $\ce{ - COOH }$ makes fatty acids [[Carboxylic Acid]].

[[Ester Linkages]] are [[Dehydration Synthesis]] between [[Fatty Acids]] and [[Glycerol]], where the $\ce{ - OH }$ of the glycerol interacts with the $\ce{ - COOH }$ of the fatty acid. 

I want to call the terminal end a [[C-Terminus]], but it refers to a different context.

Fatty acids can be classified as [[Saturated Fatty Acids]] or [[Unsaturated Fatty Acids]] depending if the carbon skeleton contains a double bond between carbons, minimizing or maximizing the saturation of Hydrogen. The double bonds in unsaturated fats are almost always [[Cis-Trans Isomers|Cis]] [[Double Covalent Bonds]], and disruption of hydrogen placements create a kink.
