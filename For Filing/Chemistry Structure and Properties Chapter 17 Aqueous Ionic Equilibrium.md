# Buffer Solutions

[[Buffers]] are solutions that resist change in [[Potential of Hydrogen|pH]] when [[Acids]] or [[Bases]] are added to the [[Solutions]]
Components of buffer neutralize acid or base added to buffered solution
Buffers need significant amounts of weak acid and its conjugate base or vice versa
Blood has a mixture of $\ce{ H_{2}CO_{3} }$ and $\ce{ HCO_{3}- }$, the [[Conjugate Bases]]

# Making an Acidic Buffer Solution

Must contain significant amounts of [[Weak Acids]] and its conjugate, or [[Weak Bases]] and its conjugates
Conjugate bases are typically added as [[Ionic Compounds|Salts]]

# Acidic Buffer Solution Behavior

## Adding small amount of strong base?

Weak acids will neutralize the addition of strong base
If amount of strong base is less than the amount of existing acetic acid, the ph change is small

# How All Buffers Work - The Le Chatelier's Principle

## For an acidic buffer solution

### Addition of base to the acidic buffer solution

Buffer solutions contain a lot of weak acid (HA) molecules

$\ce{ HA(aq) + OH-(aq)->A-(aq) + H_{2}O(l) }$

# Calculating the pH of a Buffer Solution using ICE

1. Write balanced equation for ionization of the acid and use it as a guide to prepare an ICE table
2. 
# Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

[[Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation]] 

$$\ce{ pH = pK_{a} + \log \frac{[base]}{[acid]} }$$
[[x is Small Approximation]] 

Confirm [[x is Small Approximation]] by calculating H3O+ concentration
It needs to be less than 5% of initial concentration of the acid for x is small approximation to be valid
