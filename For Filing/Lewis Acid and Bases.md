[[Lewis Acid and Bases]] is an extended definition of of [[Br√∏nsted Lowry Acid and Bases]]. Lewis new theory was a generalized explanation on acids and bases based on structure and bonding.

Instead of proton transfer, [[Lewis Acid and Bases]] state that [[Acids]] and [[Bases]] act as [[Electrons]] donors or acceptors.

Lewis acids accepts electron pairs, called [[Electrophiles]] and have vacant orbitals. 

Lewis Bases donate electron pairs, called [[Nucleophiles]], while having lone pair electrons.
