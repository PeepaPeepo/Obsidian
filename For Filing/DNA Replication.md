[[DNA Replication]] is the copying of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] with the use of a variety of [[Enzymes]], and it varies between [[Eukarya]] and [[Prokaryotes]]

There are three [[Hypothesis|Hypothesized]] forms of [[DNA Replication]]: [[Conservative Replications]], [[Semi-Conservative Replications]], and [[Dispersive Replications]]. They are still unconfirmed at the time of writing. 


[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] initiates at [[Origins of Replication]] and is opened by [[Helicase]] and forms [[Replication Forks]] and [[Replication Bubbles]]. 
[[Single Stranded Binding Proteins]] bind to the [[Sugar-Phosphate Backbones]] of the [[Parent Strands|Parental Strands]] and keeps it retracted and in a linear conformation.
[[Parent Strands|Parental Strands]] become a [[Template Strands]] for new [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]
[[Replication Bubbles]] increase torsional pressure on untouched [[Parent Strands|Parental Strands]] and is remedied with [[Topoisomerases]] which cut and swivel the strands.

[[Primase]] attaches to [[Origins of Replication]] and lays out an [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] [[Primers]] in 5' - 3' direction for about 5 - 10 [[Nucleotides]] long.

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase III|DNA Pol III]] builds off the [[Primers]] [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] forming [[Leading Strands]] up until the [[Replication Forks]]
In the opposing corner, [[Lagging Strands]] are formed in fragments called [[Okazaki Fragments]].

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerases I|DNA Pol I]] gets rid of [[Primers]], but leaves a gap

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Ligases|DNA Ligases]] join the backbones together
