[[Molecules]] that contain [[Hydrogen]] bonded to either [[Oxygen]], [[Nitrogen]], or [[Fluorine]] can form a stronger [[Dipole Moments|Dipole-Dipole Forces]]

 - A type of [[Intermolecular Forces]]
 - Due the nature of [[Polar Covalent Bonds|Polar Covalent Bonds]], Oxygen [[Atoms|atoms]] have  $\delta^-$ charges that are naturally attracted $\ce{ \delta+ }$ found in Hydrogen atoms of water [[Molecules]]
 - The relatively weak attraction is the basis for a [[Hydrogen Bonds|Hydrogen Bond]]
 - They are about 1/20 strong as [[Covalent Bonds|covalent bonds]]
 - Hydrogen bonds constantly break and reform in very short intervals, trillionths of a second
 - Water molecules bond to its neighboring molecules
 - Water can sometimes dissociate a hydrogen because of the polarity of water molecules, forming a [[Hydronium Ions]] and [[Hydroxide]] [[Ions]]
