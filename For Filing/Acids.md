[[Acids]] are solutions that have a higher concentrations of H+ ions, or [[Hydronium Ions]], in relation to its [[Hydroxide]] Ions. 

[[Arrhenius Acid and Bases]] definition states that [[Acids]] produce $\ce{ H+ }$ ions in [[Aqueous Solutions]].

Acids are sour in taste, can dissolve [[Metals]], and turns [[Litmus Paper]] red.

In [[Molecular Formulas]], [[Ionization|ionizable]] hydrogen ions are written on the front or back end, away from interior hydrogen ions.

$$\ce{ HCl or HCHO_{2} }$$

# Common Acids

[[Hydrochloric Acid]] $\ce{ HCl }$
[[Sulfuric Acid]] $\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$
[[Nitric Acid]] $\ce{ HNO_{3} }$
[[Acetic Acid]] $\ce{ HC_{2}H_{3}O_{2} }$
[[Carbonic Acids]] $\ce{ H_{2}CO_{3} }$
