# Concept 8.1 An Organism's metabolism transforms matter and energy

[[Metabolism]] is an emergent property of life that are from methodical actions between [[Molecules]].

## Metabolic Pathways 

[[Metabolic Pathways]] are multistep [[Chemical Reactions]] for specific [[Molecules]] resulting into certain [[Products]]. Each step is [[Catalysts|catalyzed]] by specific [[Enzymatic Proteins|Enzymes]]. 

$$\ce { A ->[Enzyme 1][Reaction 1] B ->[Enzyme 2][Reaction 2] C ->[Enzyme 3][Reaction 3] D }$$

Mechanisms that regulate the enzymes balance metabolic supply and demand.

Metabolism manages material and energy resources of the cell. Metabolic pathways that break down macromolecules into smaller polymers are called [[Catabolic Pathways]], also know as breakdown pathways. This includes [[Cellular Respiration]] which breaks down glucose and other organic fuels with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide water.

This process is technically a [[Combustion Reactions]] because other the products include carbon dioxide and water. Combustion is a form of [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]].

Pathways can have more than one starting reactant or products.

Energy in macromolcules are simplified to be used for cellular work.

[[Anabolic Pathways]], also known as Biosynthetic Pathways, consume [[Energy]] to build macromolecules from simpler ones. 

Examples include [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of [[Amino Acids]] from simpler [[Molecules]], and synthesis of [[Proteins]] from [[Amino Acids]].

Energy released from catabolic pathways can be stored to be used in anabolic pathways.

[[Bioenergetics]] is the study of how energy flows through living [[Organisms]].

## Forms of Energy

[[Energy]] is the capacity to cause change or do work. It is the ability to rearrange a collection of matter.

[[Thermal Energy]] is kinetic energy associated with the random movement of atoms or molecules, the transfer of thermal energy is called [[Heat]].

[[Potential Energy]] is energy matter possess because of its location or structure.

[[Chemical Energy]] is the potential energy that can be release during [[Chemical Reactions]].

[[Glucose]] is high in [[Chemical Energy]], during [[Catabolic Pathways]] bonds are broken and formed. Releasing energy and resulting in lower energy breakdown products.

This is similar to car engine combustion.

Chemical energy is compromised with light energy absorbed by plants during photo synthesis. [[Organisms]] are energy transformers. 

## The Laws of Energy Transformation

The study of energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter is called [[Thermodynamics]].

[[Systems]] denote matter under study and the rest of the universe are called [[Surroundings]]. [[Isolated Systems]] are closed off from other surroundings, [[Open Systems]] can interact with surroundings.

[[Organisms]] are [[Open Systems]], they can absorb energy and release heat and metabolic wase products to the surroundings. 

Two laws of thermodynamics govern energy transformations in organisms and all other collections of matter.

## The First Law of Thermodynamics

[[First Law of Thermodynamics]] states that Energy can be transferred and transformed, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The law is also known as [[Principle of Conservation of Energy]]

Plants act as energy transformers.

# The Second Law of Thermodynamics

[[Entropy]] is a measure of molecular disorder or randomness. The more disordered a collection of matter is, the greater the Entropy.

[[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] states that every energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe. 

The disintegration of a systems organized structure is a good analogy for an increase in entropy. 

The decay of unmaintained buildings over time shows the increase of entropy.

Processes that can proceed without requiring an input of energy are known as [[Spontaneity]] or [[Exergonic Reactions]] processes. It states that its energetically favorable. 

Processes that leads to a decrease in entropy is nonspontaneous or [[Endergonic Reactions]] which will only happen if energy is supplied.

## Biological Order and Disorder

Living systems increase entropy of their surroundings. Increase in order is balanced by an organism's taking in organized forms of matter and energy from the surroundings and replacing them with less ordered forms.

Animals obtains starch, proteins, and other complex macromolecules from food. Catabolic pathways release $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ and $\ce{ \ce{ H_{2}O } }$. Energy flows into most ecosystems in the form of light and exits in the form of heat. 

# Concept 8.2 The Free-Energy Change of a Reaction Tells us whether or not the reaction occurs spontaneously

It is useful to determine if a process is [[Endergonic Reactions]] or [[Exergonic Reactions]].

## Free-Energy Change $\ce{ \Delta G }$ 

[[J. Willard Gibbs]] defined a function called [[Gibbs Free Energy Change]] of a [[Systems]] denoted as $\ce{ G }$. Gibbs free energy can be referred to as Free Energy

The change in free energy, $\ce{ \Delta G }$ can be calculated for a chemical reaction with the following equation. 

$\ce{ \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S }$

The equation uses only properties of a the system, or the reaction, itself.

$\ce{ \Delta H }$ symbolizes the change in the system's [[Enthalpy]], which is the the same as total energy in a biological system. 

$\Delta S$ is the change in the system's [[Entropy]]

$\ce{ T }$ is the absolute temperatures in Kelvin.

DeltaG can be measured for any reaction. Value can depend on [[pH Scale]], [[Temperature]], and concentration of [[Reactants]] and [[Products]].

The value of $\ce{ \Delta G }$ can predict whether the process will be spontaneous or nonspontaneous.

Processes with Negative DeltaG are spontaneous.
	DeltaH must be negative
	Or TDeltaS must be positive
	Or Both
Processes that have a positive or zero DeltaG are never spontaneous

## Free Energy, Stability, and Equilibrium

Spontaneous processes have a Negative DeltaG

$$\ce{ \Delta G = G_{final State} - G_{Initial State} }$$

Free energy can be though of a measure of a systems of instability, the tendency to change to a more stable state. 

Unstable states have Higher DeltaG's that become a mroe stable or lower DeltaG

Systems that are unstable will move towards greater stability.

The state of maximum stability is known as [[Equilibrium]], forward and reverse reactions occur at teh same rate and there is no very change

Equilibirum as free energy valley, any change from teh equilibrium position will have a positive Delta G and will not be spontaneous.

A process is spontaneous and cna perform work only when it is moving towards equilibrium.

## Free Energy and Metabolism

Free energy concept can be applied to biological processes

## Exergonic and Endergonic Reactions in Metabolism


[[Exergonic Reactions]] proceeds with net release of free energy. Negative Delta G is for exergonic reactions. 

Reaction for cellular respiration is as follows

$\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6 O_{2} -> 6CO_{2} + 6 H_{2}O}$
$\ce{ \Delta G = -686\frac{kcal}{mol}(-2870kJ/mol) }$

Each mole of glucose broken down by respiration under [[Standard Conditions]] 686 kcal of energy is made for work.

Chemical products of respiration store 686 kcal less free energy per mole than the reactants

[[Endergonic Reactions]] absorb free energy from its surroundings. Free energy is stored in reactions and Delta G is positive

PLants capture light from the sun and convert it to chemical energy.

In exergonic steps they spend chemical energy to assembly glucose molecules.

## Equilibrium and Metabolism

Reactions in isolated system eventually reach equilibrium.

Chemical reactions of metabolism are reversible, Metabolism is never at equilibrium is one of the defining features of life.

# Concept 8.3 ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions 

A cell has three kinds of work: [[Chemical Work]], [[Transport Work]], and [[Mechanical Work]]

[[Chemical Work]]
- Pushing of endergonic reactions
- Synthesis of polymers from monomers

[[Transport Work]] 
- Pumping of substances across membranes against the direction of spontaneous movement

[[Mechanical Work]]
- Beating of cilia
- Contraction of muscle cells
- movement of chromosomes during cellular reproduction

Energy resources to do work is [[Energy Coupling]], the use of exergonic process to drive an endergonic one

[[Adenosine Triphosphate]] contains a [[Ribose]], three [[Phosphate Groups]], and an [[Adenine]] [[Nucleobases|Nucleobase]] 

Bonds of ATP can be broken by [[Hydrolysis]], the [[Terminal Phosphate Bond]] of the [[Gamma Phosphates]] are broken by the addition of a water molecule. The [[Gamma Phosphates]] leave the triphospate group and becomes $\ce{ HOPO_{3}^2- }$, also abbreviated as $\ce{ P_{i} }$.

The resulting ATP is now a [[Adenosine Diphosphate]] because of the missing [[Gamma Phosphates]]. The reaction is [[Exergonic Reactions|Exergonic]] and releases $\ce{ 7.3 kcal }$ of energy per mole of ATP hydrolyzed.

$$\ce{ ATP + H_{2}O -> ADP + P_{i} }$$
$$\ce{ \Delta G = - 7.3 kcal/mol*-30.5 kJ/mol }$$

Phosphates bond breaks release energy and are referred to [[High Energy Phosphate Bonds]]. The reactants of ATP and Water have high energy relative to the products.

The release of energy during the ATP change change teh state of the system to a state of lower energy.

Phosphate interaction has higher reactions compared to other molecules. 

The mutual negative charges have a repulsive characteristic causing instability.
The gamma phosphate is like a compressed spring ready to go from the repulsion of the negative charges.

## How ATP provides Energy that Perform Work

The process of shivering is the use of ATP hydrolysis during muscle contraction to warm the body.

With the help of specific [[Enzymes]] the cell is able to use high free energy of atp to drive chemical reactions that are [[Endergonic Reactions]] 

If the $\Delta G$ of endergonic reaction is less than ATP release energy, the two reactions can be coupled to become exergonic. 

This involves [[Phosphorylation]], where the phosphate group transfers to other molecules such as the reactant.

The recipient molcule is called the [[Phosphorylated Intermediate]], which is teh key to couplking exergonic and enrgonic reaections.

[[Transport Work]] and [[Mechanical Work]] are almost always powered by ATP Hydrolysis

It can lead to change in proteins shape and ability to bind. 

This occurs in phosphorylated intermediates.

## Regeneration of ATP 

The [[Gibbs Free Energy Change|Free Energy]] required to [[Phosphorylation|Phosphorylate]] ADP comes from exergonic break down reactions [[Catabolism]] in the cell. Shuttling of phospate and energy is teh [[ATP Cycle]] 

[[Catabolism]] such as [[Cellular Respiration]] proveds energy for making ATP

# Concept 8.4 Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers 

[[Enzymes]] are macromolecules that acts as [[Catalysts]], which speeds up a reaction without being consumed by the reaction. 

some molecules such as [[Ribozymes]] can function as enzymes.

## The Activation Energy Barrier

Changing molecules involves contorting the starting molecule into a highly unstable state before the reaction moves.

The investment of energy for starting a reaction the energy required to contor reactants so bonds can break is known as [[Free Energy of Activation]], $\ce{ E_{A} }$

It is the teh amount of energy to push the reaction into an exergonic state.
It is supllied by heat in the form of thermal enery that teh reactant molecules absorb from the surroundings.

The abosorption of heat accelerates reactant molcules so the collid more frequently and stronger

It agitates atoms and their bonds, the unstable condition is known as [[Transition States]]

$\ce{ AB + CD -> AC + B }$

This looks likes [[Single-Displacement Reactions]] and [[Decomposition Reactions]]

Free energy content of the reactants molecule increases then eventually meets a transition point where bonds can be broken.

## How Enzymes Speed Up Reactions

Laws of [[Thermodynamics]] favor the break down of molecules that are rich in [[Gibbs Free Energy Change|Free Energy]]

[[Organisms]] carry out [[Catalysis]] 

[[Enzymes]] [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] [[Chemical Reactions]] by lowering the [[Free Energy of Activation|Energy of Activation]] and lets the reactant work at body temperature.

[[Enzymes]] cannot change delta G of a reaction, cannot change [[Endergonic Reactions]] into [[Exergonic Reactions]]

It only speeds up reactions that occur normally

## Substrate Specificity of Enzymes

Substances [[Enzymes]] work on are called [[Substrates]] 
[[Enzymes]] bind on to [[Substrates]] and forms an [[Enzyme Substrate Complex]]
After binding, the [[Enzymes]] [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] the reaction of the reactant and turn it into an [[Products]], which often are [[Intermediate Products]]
[[Enzymes]] are specific for [[Molecules]] which they are designed for
Most [[Enzymes]] are [[Enzymatic Proteins]] which a unique shape
The specific part that makes contact and catalyzes reactions are [[Active Sites]]
They are often formed by a few of the [[Enzymes]] [[Amino Acids]], and the rest are mostly structural to form the shape of the active site

[[Enzymes]] are not completely rigid and can change conformations depending if its activated or not

The chemical groups of the active sites and the substrate interact, the tightening of the binding after intial contact is called [[Induced Fit]] 

## Catalysis in the Enzyme's Active Site 

[[Enzyme Substrate Complex]] are joined by [[Weak Chemical Interactions]], reactant converts into a product, its available for another reactant. One [[Enzymes]] can typically process 1,000 substrate molecules per second

[[Enzymes]] have a few mechanisms that lower activation energy and speed up reaction

Reactions that involve two or more [[Reactants]], active sites provide a template which teh substrates can come together in proper orientation for reactions to occur

Enzymes can stretch substrate molcules towards their transition state form, getting it closer to the form where bonds can be broken

Some enzymes can provide the acidity needed to process some molecules

Some side chains can directly participate with substrate reaction

More substrate molecules can frequently use thier active sites
There is a [[Saturation Points]] for enzymes where they cant work anymore

## Effects of Local Conditions on Enzyme Activity 157(206)-160

High temp can increase frequency of collsion of molecules
too hot breaks the hydroge bonds and other weak interactions of enzyme

Optimal pH values range fomr 6-8
Human pepsin works best at lower pH

## Cofactors
 
[[Cofactors]] can be found bound to enzymes or substrates and they help catalytic activity
Some cofactors include zinc, iron, and ionic copper
If a cofactor is organic it is a [[Coenzymes]]

## Enzyme Inhibitors

[[Competitive Inhibitors]] mimic the target substrate to inhibit [[Active Sites]], but is reversible
They can be outnumbered by target [[Substrates]] to stop inhibition

[[Noncompetitive Inhibitors]] behind to part of the enzyme to change active site effectiveness

[[Toxins]] and [[Poisons]] are often irreversible [[Enzyme Inhibitors]]

# The Evolution of Enzymes

Most enzymes are [[Proteins]] which are encoded by [[Genes]]
[[Mutations]] in genes result in a change of amino acids and can affect function of enyzme
Natural selection will let the mutation be itself

# Concept 8.5 Regulation of Enzyme Activity helps control Metabolism

## Allosteric Regulation of Enzymes

[[Allosteric Regulation]] arises when a [[Proteins]] function is affected by binding [[Regulatory Molecules]] at different sites, it can turn it on or off, inhibit or stimulate

## Allosteric Activation and Inhibition

[[Enzymes]] that are [[Allosteric Regulation|Allosterically]] regulated are made of two or more subunits composted of a chain of [[Polypeptides]] with its own active site

The [[Enzyme Substrate Complex]] alternate between its subunits

Molecules bind to [[Regulatory Sites]], where subunits join.
Binding of [[Activators]] stabilizes active sites
Binding of [[Inhibitors]] stabilize the inactive sites

The activation of regulatory sites affect the other active sites

![[Figure 8.20 Allosteric regulation of enzyme activity.png]]

Fluctuating concentrations of regulators can cause specific patterns
Products of ATP hydrolysis balance flow of traffic of anabolism and catabolism pathways

[[Substrates]] binding to an active site triggers a shape in all subunits and increases the catalytic activity at other sites is called [[Cooperativity]]

# Feedback Inhibition

[[Feedback Inhibition]] is when [[Metabolic Pathways]] are halted by inhibitory binding of end product
