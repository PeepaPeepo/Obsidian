[[Antidiuretic Hormone|ADH]] is one of the types of [[Hormones]] that regulate water levels, blood pressure, and blood volume.

If blood levels are low, ADH is released to promote permeability of water at the "collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule of the nephron". This allows for reabsorption of water to increase blood volume and pressure to achieve homeostasis.

The previous statement illudes to the idea that a certain blood threshold would cause a negative feedback loop if enough blood is present
