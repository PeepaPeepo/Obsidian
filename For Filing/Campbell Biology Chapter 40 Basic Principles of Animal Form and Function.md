Adaptations in form, function, and behavior
[[Anatomy]], [[Physiology]], and [[Behavior]]

# Concept 40.1 Animals form and function are correlated at all levels of organization

Animals need nutrients and oxygent to function
Anatomy varies widely
Clues to [[Physiology]]

# Hierarchical Organization of Body Plans

Most cells organize into [[Tissues]]
Tissues make up [[Organs]]

# Organ systems

[[Digestive Systems]]
[[Circulatory Systems]]
[[Immune and Lymphatic Systems]]
[[Excretory Systems]]
[[Endocrine Systems]]
[[Reproductive System]]
[[Nervous System]]
[[Integumentary System]]
[[Skeletal Systems]]
[[Muscular Systems]]

# Concept 40.2: Feedback control maintains the internal environment in many animals

Regulation or conforming 
[[Regulators]] uses internal controal mechanisms to control internal change
[[Conformers]] allows its internal condition to vary with certain external changes

## Homeostasis

[[Homeostasis]] is to maintain a stead state and constant internal environment
Body temp, pH and glucose concentration

## Mechanisms of Homeostasis

maintain to a particular value [[Set Point]]
[[Stimulus]] fluctuation above or below the set is detected by a [[Sensor]]

## Feedback Control in Homeostasis

[[Negative Feedback]] damps a stimulus
[[Positive Feedback]] amplifies a stimulus and does no play a major role in homeostasis

## Alteration in Homeostasis

Set points and nomral ranges can change with age or variation
[[Circadian Rhythms]] governs physiological changes that occur every 24 hours
Homeostasis is sometimes altered by [[Acclimatization]], change adjusts to changes in its external environment

# Concept 40.3: Homeostatic processes for thermoregulation involve form, function, and behavior

[[Thermoregulation]] maintain temperature 37 C or 96-99 F
[[Endothermy|Endothermic]] animals generate heat by metabolism
[[Ectothermic]] animals gain heat from external sources
[[Endothermy]] is expensive
[[Ectothermy]] can tolerate greater variation in internal temperature
[[Poikilotherm]] varies with environments
[[Homeotherm]] is relatively constant
Relationship is not fixed

## Behavioral Responses

[[Acclimatization]] 
	birds and mamals can adjust their insulation
	Lipid composition of cell membranes may change with temperature
	Subzer some ectothemrs produce antifreeze compounds

## Physiological Thermostats and Fever

[[Hypothalamus]] regulates temp
[[Fever]] is a response to some infection
Some ectotermic organisim warmers to respond to infections
Blood vessel in skin dialtes inresponse to warmth, sweat

# Concept 40.4 Energy requirements are related to animals size, activity, and environment

[[Bioenergetics]] is the overall flow and transformation of energy in an animal 
Energy containing moeleucles used to make ATP
[[Biosynthesis]] includes body growth and repair synthesis of storage material such as fat, and production of gametes 

# Quantifying Energy Use

[[Metabolic Rate]] is the sum of all energy an animal uses in a unit of time
	Determined by heat loss or amount of oxygen consuemd
	Measuring energy content of food consumed and energy lost in wastes

## Minimum metabolic rate

[[Basal Metabolic Rate]] is the rest with empty stomach and no stress
[[Standard Metabolic Rate]] is rate of fasting, nonstressed ectrothemr at rest
Most terrestrial animals the average rate is about two to four times BMR
[[Torpor]] is a pyhsiological state of decreaseed activity and metabolism
Save energy while avoiding difficult and dangerous conditions
[[Hibernation]] is longterm [[Torpor]] that is an adaptation to winter cold and food scarcity
