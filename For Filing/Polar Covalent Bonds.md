- When an [[Atoms|Atom]] bonds with an [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] atom, it forms a Polar Covalent Bond
- [[Polarity]] is based on the relative difference in electronegativity
	- H has electronegativity value of 2.2
	- O has electronegativity value of 3.5
	- O would have $\delta -$
	- H would have $\delta +$
- Two atoms of the same kind or similar electronegativity do not form polar covalent bonds, but [[Nonpolar Covalent Bond]]

# Questions 

- Most Bonds form because of the [[Octet Rule]]
	- Atoms with incomplete valence shells can interactive with other atoms to complete its valence
	- Atoms tend to balance their valence shell
