$$\ce{ \lambda }$$
[[Wavelengths]] are the distances between [[Wave Crests]], and it is inversely proportionate to [[Frequencies|Frequency]]. Shorter wavelengths lead to higher frequency. 

The shortest wavelengths on the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum]] are [[Gamma Rays]], and the longest are [[Radio Waves]].
