[[Population Ecology]] is teh study of factors affecting the size of population and how it changes over time

# Concept 53.1 Biotic and Abiotic factors affect population density, dispersion, and demographics

[[Populations]], N,  is a group of individuals of a single species living in the same general area 
Described by boundaries and size
May be natural or arbitrarily defined by an investigator
[[Density]] is the number of individuals per unit area or volume

## Density: A dynamic perspective

Sasmpling techniques can be used to estimate densities
Randomly located plots
Indicator of population size, number of nests, burrows, tracks, and fecal droppings
[[Mark-Recapture Method]]

## Determining Population size using the mark recapture method

Capture, tag, release
Capture a second sample of individuals
Data is collected
x/N = s/N or N = sn/x
Better with larger sizes
[[Density]] increases with decreases as individuals are added or removed
[[Immigration]] is the influx of new individuals from other areas, birthds increase population size
[[Emigration]] is teh movement of indiviudals out of a population, and deaths decrease

## Patterns of Dispersion

[[Dispersion]] is determined by the spacing among individuals within the boundaries of a population
[[Clumped]], individual aggregate in patches
Aggregate in areas of high resource availability
Sea stars can clump
[[Uniform]] dispersion evenly spaced
Plants secerete 
Animals often exhibit [[Territoriality]]
[[Random]] dispersion occurs in absence of strong attractions or repulsions among individuals or constant distribution of key physical or chemical factors

### Demographics

[[Birth]], [[Death]], [[Migration]] rates
[[Demography]] studies of vital statisstics of population

## Life Tables

[[Life Tables]] is an age specific summary of the survival and reproductive rates within a population
[[Cohorts]] individual of same age is followed 
[[Static Life Tables]] Snapshot of population and ages
Requires a method of determining the proportion of individuals survigin from one age group to the next

## Survivorship Curves

[[Survivorship Curves]] a plot of the roportion or numbers in a cohort still alive at each age
Three different types
[[Type I Survivorship Curve]] low death rates during early and middle life and a sharp increase in death rates later in life
Found in large mammals, that produce offspring but provide them with good parental care
Applicable to humans
[[Type II Survivorship Curve]] constant rate of death
Type III High death rates for hte young deeath rate setteply declines for survivor of early period die off
Oysters feed on bacteria
Opportunistic Life 
Life Strategies
	more than 10 year life spand
	Reproduce a lot
Many species are intermediate to these curves or show more complex patterns
Crabs have stiar stepped curve with during molts

## Reproductive Rates

Reproductive output varies with number of breeding females and their ages 
Direct counts, mark recapture, and molecular tols
	DNA profiling
	Estimate the number of breeding females
 Average number of female offspring produced by hte famles in an age group
 
# Concept 53.2 The exponential model describes population growth in an idealized unlimited enviornment

Populations can expand when resources are abundant their reproductive potnetial
Unlimited growht is unsustainable

## Changes in population sizes

Change in population size during a fixed time interval can be dfeind by hte folowing verbal equation

Changine in N = birth + immigrants - deat - emigrants
If immigration and emigration are ignored, the change in population size equalts brithds minus deaths

Population growth equation can be revised to deltaN/Deltat = R
Population growth can also be expressed as a rate of change at each instnat in time
dN/dt=rN

[[Exponential Population Grown]] occurs under ideal conditions all individuals hve access to abundant food and reproduce at physiological capactiy
Equation is

$$\ce{ \frac{dN}{dt}=rN }$$
r = [[Intrinsic Rate of Increase]]
J shaped Cruve when population size is plotted over time
The per capita rate of increase is constant, but more new individuals are added per unit time when the populations

Introduction to new environment
Rebounding after drastic deduction by a catastropihc event

## Carrying Capacity (K)

[[Carrying Capacity]] varies over space and time with abundance of limiting resources

Energy, shelter, refuge from predators, nutrient availability, water, and suitable nesting sites are all limiting factors

## The logistic growth model

[[Logistic Population Growth Model]] the per capita rate of population growth approaches zero as population size nears carrying capacity
Logistic model starts with the exponential model and adds an expression that reduces per capita 
Logistic model produces a [[Sigmoid]] an S Shaped Currve
When population is plotted over time
Population growth rate decreases as n apporaches K
Predict rate of recovery for small populations 
Estimating sustainable harvest rates for wildlife
estimating the critical size below which popluations become at risk for extinction
