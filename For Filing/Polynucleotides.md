[[Polynucleotides]] are [[Nucleic Acids|Nucleic Acid]] [[Polymers]], that are made of [[Nucleotides|Nucleotide]] [[Monomers]]. Adjacent [[Nucleotides]] form [[Phosphodiester Linkages]], where the [[Phosphate Groups]] covalently binds the sugars together. The results are [[Sugar-Phosphate Backbones]] for [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]]. 

The [[Sugar-Phosphate Backbones]] give [[Polynucleotides]] [[5' Ends]] and [[3' Ends]]. 5' ends contains [[Phosphate Groups]] and 3' contains [[Hydroxyl Groups]].
