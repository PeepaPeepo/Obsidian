[[Tertiary Structures]] of a [[Proteins]] are caused by the interaction of the [[Side Chains]] of the [[Amino Acids]] of the [[Primary Structures]]. There are multiple interactions involved in tertiary structure, [[Hydrophobic Interactions]], [[Van der Waals Interactions]], and [[Hydrophilic Interaction]]. [[Hydrophobic Interactions]] cause the [[Nonpolar]] side chains to cluster away from water, and then have [[Van der Waals Interactions|Van der Waals Forces]] act on each to each other. Then polar side chains can form [[Hydrogen Bonds]].  [[Ions|Ionized]] side chains can form [[Ionic Bonds]].

[[Cysteine]] can form [[Disulfide Bridges]] in [[Tertiary Structures]].
