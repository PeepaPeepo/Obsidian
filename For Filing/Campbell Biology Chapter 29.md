# What were the major developkemts in the evolution of plants

From [[Green Algae]]
[[Nonvascular]] plants
[[Seedless Vascular]]

# Concept 29.1 Plants came from green algae

[[Charophytes]] are closest relatives of plants

## Evidence of Algal Ancestry

## Adaptations

Charophytes have a coating of [[Sporopollenin]], a polymer that prevents zygote to dry out
Found in spore walls
Unfiltered sun light

Plants with embryos [[Embryophytes]]
[[Alternation of Generations]]
[[Gametophytes]] vs [[Sporophyte]]

## Multicelluar Dependent embyros

Diploid [[Embryos]] are retained and protected within tissue of female gametophyte

## Walled Spores Produced in Sporangia

Spore walls contain [[Sporopollenin]]

## Apical Meristems

[[Apical Meristems]] are localized regions of cell division at the tips of roots and shots
[[Cuticles]] is a waxy covering of the epidermis that reduces water loss
[[Stomata]] are pores that function in gas exchange
Symbiotic associates with fungi [[Mycorrhizae]]
[[Lichen]]

## The origin and diversification of plants

Microorganisms colonized lands 3.2 billion years ago
Most plants have [[Vascular Tissues]]

## Bryophytes

Nonvascular plants lack an extensive transport system
Not a monophyletic group

# Concept 29.2 Mosses and Other nonvascular plants have life cycles dominated by gametopytes

[[Liverworts]]
[[Mosses]]
[[Hornworts]]
[[Haploid]] [[Gametophytes]] are dominant in all bryophytes
[[Gametophytes]] can produce multiple [[Gametangia]]
[[Archegonia]] female gametgani rpdouce a single nonmotile egg
[[Antheridia]] male gametoangia rpdouce many motile sperm
[[Archegonium]]

## Bryophyte Sporophytes

Atttached to and dependent on the gametophyte

# 29.13 exploring Bryophyte diversity liverwors

Named for liver shaped gametophytes
Some speices have gametangia elevated on stalks
Others have stemlike gametophytes with many leaf like appendages

## Hornworts ANytocerophyta

Sporophytes are long and tapered horn shaped structures
spores are released when horns split open
gametophytes are usually 1 - 2 cm diamter
Form symbioses with nitrogen fixing bacteria

## Mosses

Gametophytes are usually less than 15 cm tall but range from 1 mm to 60 cm
sporophytes ar eusually visible to the naked eye
green and photosyntheic when young, then brown before sprores
Common in wet areas
Ihabit extreme weather
colonized and help retain nigtrogen in bare sandy soils
*Sphagnum* or peat moss forms extensive depostics of partially decayed organic material know as [[Peat]]
USed as a source of full

## Life Cycles with DOminant Sporophytes

Seedless vascular plants the sporophytes are larger and complex than gametophytes
Ferns 

## Evolution of Roots

Roots are organs that anchor vascular plants into the ground and absorb water and nutrients

## Evolution of Leaves

Leaves increase surface area for light capture and conduct most of the photosynthesis in plants
[[Microphylls]] small and spine shaped leaves with a single vein in [[Lycophytes]]
[[Megaphylls]] larger leaves wtih a highkly brancehd vascualr system
[[Sporophylls]] are modified leaves with [[Sporangia]]
Sori are clusters of sporangia on the undersides of fern
Many lycophytes are most gymnosperms have [[Strobili]] that are cone like
Sporophylls of angiosperms are called [[Carpels]] and [[Stamens]]
[[Homosporous]] most seedles vascular plants
[[Heterosporous]] they have two types of sporophylls bearing different sporangia that produce different sports

## Classification of Seedless Vascular Plants

[[Lycophyta]] includes club mosses, spike mosses, and quillworts
[[Phylum Monilophyta]] includes ferns, horsetails

Spike moss as animal bedding

# 29.19 Exploring Seedless vascular plant diveristy

Lycophytes grow in diverse habittats
Some [[Gametophytes]] are photosynthetic
[[Sporophyte]] have both leaf forming upright stems
SPike mosses and quil are hetero sporus
Spike mosses and club mosses have strobili

## Monilophytes

Inlcudes ferns, horsetails, and wisk fern and relatives
Horsetails as brushes or tooth brushes

Psiolotum wisk fern and relatives

## Ferns

[[Megasporophylls]] 
A front is coilied 
Homospororus

## Horsetails

Gritty stems have used for scouring pots

## Whisk ferns and relatives

Wihisk fern sporophytes have dicotomously branching stems

## Phylum Lycophyta: Club mosses, spike mosses, and quillworts

Lycopyhtes diversified into small herbacesous plants and giant trees by the caroniferous period

## Significance of Seedless vascualr plants

Forests of lycophytes horsetails and ferns formed during the devonian and carboniferous periods

Tree roots broke down rocks releasesing chemciasl that reacted with CO2
Decay was skiw ub carbibuferiys swamps
