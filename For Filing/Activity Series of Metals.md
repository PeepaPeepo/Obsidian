[[Activity Series of Metals]] is a table of [[Metals]] in the order of highest tendency to lose electrons to lower tendencies. [[Metals]] of a higher tier can produce [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] reactions with [[Half-Reactions]] of a lower tier. This can be also utilized in determining if metal is dissolved with [[Acids]]. Metals above $\ce{ H_{2} }$ is dissolvable by the half reaction of $\ce{ H_{2} }$.
