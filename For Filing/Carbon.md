- Carbon is a foundational [[Elements]] in [[Organic Chemistry]]
- Due to its [[Valence|valence]] of six, the remaining four [[Valence Electrons|valence electrons]] gives the potential to make a variety of single or double [[Covalent Bonds]] with another carbon atom or other elements
- When all bonds are single, it creates a tetrahedral structure, 
- [[Bonding Angles]] of a all single bond carbon is about 109.5Ëš
- The unique nature lets carbon form [[Carbon Skeletons]] that other [[Organic Molecules|organic molecules]] bind to
- The structure and composition determines the organic molecule's function
- Carbon skeletons can form very complex structures
