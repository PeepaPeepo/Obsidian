#  Chemistry

Understand what matter does
What atoms and molecules do
Virtually everything is composed of chemicals
How the atoms and molecules behave

# Atoms and Molecules in Matter

- Atoms are very small
- atoms and molecules are tiny particles that compose all common matter
- atoms are bound together to make different types of molecules
	- 2 or more atoms are a molecule
- Chemical bonds are the attachments that hold atoms together
- Atoms are just elements with different atomic numbers

##  Example

H20 
Two chemical bonds
3 Atoms of water
1 mole h2o = 6.22x10^23 molecules of h20

##  Water Molecules

- Three atoms
	- One oxygen
	- Two hydrogen 
	- Water molecule is bent
	- The characteristics of water molecules make a water a liquid at room tempature
		- 22-25 C is room temperature
- If has a different structure it behaves differently

# Chemicals Compose Ordinary Things

- Everything is made of chemicals
- Everything we come into contact is made of chemicals
- Most people think of chemicals as dangerous
- Sample
	- Air
	- Water
	- Toothpaste, tylenol, toilet paper
- Chemistry explains properties and behavior of chemical 

# All Things are made of Atoms and Molecules

Richard Feynman
1918-1988
Nobel Prize Winning
California Institute of Tech

# Chemistry

The science that tries to understand how matter behaves by studying how atoms and molecules behave

# The Scientific Method: How Chemist Think

# Ways to understand the world

- Scientific Method
- Way of learning that emphasizes observation and experimentation
- produce knowledge as the result of the senses
	- Observations
		- Involve measuring some aspect of nature
	- Hypotheses
		- Tentative interpretations of the observation
	- Laws
		- Summarize the results of a large number of observations
	- Theories
		- Models that explain and give underlying cause for observations and laws

# Ancient Philosophy and Medieval Applications

- In contrast to ancient Greek philo and medival application
- Reason to produce knowledge

# The Scientific Method: Experiments

Hypotheses, laws, and theories must be tested by **experiment**
If hypotheses are not confirmed, the are **revised and tested** through more experiment

# The Scientific Method: Observation

Observations made with **naked eye**
Observations emerge from experiments that rely on **sensitive instrumentation**
Observation involves the **measurement** or description of some aspect of the physical world

# Observation of Combustion

Antoine Lavoisier (1743 - 1794)
	French Chemist
	Observation about physical world
Property of mass after burning mass

# Observation of Combustion Experiments

Burned substances in closed containers
measured mass of each container and its content before and after
No change in mass during combustion
Mass of ashes are the same of the original object

# The Scientific Method: Experiments

A tentative interpretation or explanation of the observations
Good hypothesis is falsifiable, potential to prove it wrong
Tested by experiments
Results of experiment may confirm a hypothesis
Hypothesis may have to be changed or discarded
Revised hypothesis must also be tested through more experimentation
PHD inter-laboratory testing ton verify experiments 

# Law of Conservation of Mass

Number of similar observations developed scientific laws
	A brief statement that synthesizes past observations and predicts future ones
Lavoisier developed the **law of conservation of mass**
	In chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed

Atoms do not break or disappear
Account for weight of all measuring items

# The Scientific Method: Theory

One or more well-established hypotheses can form the basis for scientific theory

Theories provide a broader and deeper explanation of observation
Theories are model interpretation of nature
Predict behavior that extends through all observations

# The Scientific Method: Observation, Law, Theory 

When a metal is burned in a closed container, the mass stays the same is an observation
Matter is made of atoms is a law
Matter is conserved in chemical reactions is a law
