$$\ce{ Pyruvate ->[Coenzyme A][NAD^+->NADH + CO_{2}] Acetyl CoA }$$

[[Pyruvate Dehydrogenase]] catalyzes the following reactions: [[Pyruvate]] looses its [[Carboxyl Groups]], which leaves as $CO_{2}$, [[Pyruvate]] oxidizes and reduces [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] to produce [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]], The remaining [[Acetyl Group]] covalently links to [[Coenzyme A|CoA]] to form [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]] via [[Thioester Bonds]]

[[Pyruvate Oxidation]] occurs after [[Glycolysis]] and serves as a transitions to the [[Citric Acid Cycle]].

[[Pyruvate Dehydrogenase]] catalyzes the reaction. [[Pyruvate]] transfers electrons to [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] via [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]], It gets [[Decarboxylated]], and covalently bonds to [[Coenzyme A]] through [[Thioester Bonds]]

1 [[Pyruvate]] yields 2 $CO_{2}$ and 2 [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] and 2 [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]]
