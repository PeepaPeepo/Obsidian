 [[Electrolysis]] is the process process of using electrical energy to break [[Compounds]] apart.
 It happens within [[Electrolytic Cells]]
 [[Electrolytic Cells]] can be used to separate elements from their [[Compounds]].
 Electrical energy is used to overcome the energy barrier of a nonspontaneous reaction
 It is the reverse process of a [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] process
 Some applications of electrolysis can include: metal extractions from mineral and purification, production of H_2 for fuel cells, and metal plating.
