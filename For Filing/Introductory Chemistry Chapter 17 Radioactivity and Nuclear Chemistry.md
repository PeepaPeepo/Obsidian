## Radioactivity and Nuclear Chemistry

Nuclear medicine, uses for images 
Radioactively tagged antibodies for appendix 

## Radioactivity

[[Radioactivity]] is emission of tiny energetic partciles by nuclei of unstable atoms

## The discovery of radio activity: antoine-henri becquell

Antoine-Henri Becquerel
X-rays and greenish glow of [[Phosphorescence]]
Systems like stability of lowest energy

## Becquerel's Experiment 

Some crystals emit constant radiation
Uranium-containing crystals was teh source of emissions
Uranic Rays

## Marie Sklodowska Curie

[[Marie Sklodowska Curie]] first women in france to find other substances besides uranium
Polonium 
Radium was very radioactive and emitted a lot of heat
Some used in watches to glow in the dark
Nobel prize in physics
Discovery of [[Radioactivity]]
Curium element 96

## Types of Radioactivity: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Decay

[[Ernest Rutherford]] focusted on characterizing the radioactivity
Emission were produced by [[Atomic Nucleus]] of radioactive atoms
Emit small pieces of self in the form of light to gain stability

## Types of Radiation

[[Alpha Rays]], [[Beta Rays]], [[Gamma Rays]], and [[Positrons]]
Nuclei are unstable when too large or unbalanced ratio of neutrons to protons
1:1 Neutron to Proton
Larger neuclei need 1.5 neutrons to proton

## Isotope Notation

Top number is mass number, lower is atomic, 
Proton Symbol, neutron symcoml, electron

$\ce{ ^1_{1}P }$  1 atomic number low, 1 mass number high
$\ce{ ^1_{0}n }$  no charge 1 nuteron, no proton
$\ce{ ^0_{-1}e }$ negative charge of -1
$\ce{ ^0_{=+=1}e }$ Positron

## Alpha Radiation

[[Alpha Rays]] emit [[Alpha Particles]] composed of two protons and two neutrons
2 protons = $\ce{ ^1_{1}P }$, $\ce{ ^1_{1}P }$
1 neutron = $\ce{ ^1_{0}n }$

Alpha giving off helium

## Nuclear Equations

[[Nuclear Equation]] represent the changes that occur during radioactivity and other nuclear processes

$\ce{ ^238_{92}U -> ^234_{90}Th + ^4_{2}He }$

Interested in chances of nucleus. 
[[Parent Nuclides]] decays into [[Daughter Nuclides]]
[[Nuclides]] are specific isotopes
Original Atom and product nucldies

## Nuclear Equations must be balanced

## Assessing the Damaging Power of Radiation

Radation interacts with other molecules and atoms by ionization
Ionize is teh creation of [[Ions]]
Ionization of living organisms become damaged and cell can die
[[Ionizing Power]] is hte ability of radiation to ionize molecules
[[Penetrating Power]] ability to penetrate matters, order for radiation to damage important molecules within living cells it must penetrate the cell

## Alpha Particle Radiation Damage Potential

Alpha particle is teh largest particle
Most potential to interact and damage other molecules
Highest ionizing power
Lowest penetrating power because of the size
Can be stopped by paper or clothing
Safe outside body
Ingest or inhaled, it is different because its ionization 

## Beta Radiation

Emission of [[Electrons]], neutrons become a proton
High penetrating power, moderate ionizing power
[[Beta Decay]] is the emission of [[Electrons]]
[[Beta Particles]]

## Beta Particles Radiation Damage Potential

Less massive, and lower ionizing power
High penetrating power, needs sometjing like sheet of metal or piece of wood to stop
Beta emitters does less damage than alpha emitter

## Gamma Radiation

[[Electromagnetic Radiation|Electromagnetic Energy]]
High energy photons
Charge and massless
emitted in conjunction with types of radiation

## Damage Potential

Lowest ionizing power but highest penetrating power
Needs several inches of lead shielding or thick slabs of concrete 

## Positron Emission

[[Positrons]] occur when unstable nucleus emits a positron
Protons become a neutron in this case
Similar to beta emission 

## Detecting Radioactivity

[[Film-Badge Dosimeters]] consists of photographic film 
Monitor exposure

## Geiger-Muller Counter

Passes through a chamber that ionizes ARgon gas
It is attracted to anode and the electron is attracted to cathod

[[Scintillation Counter]] where radioactivity emissions pass through a material and emit ultraviolet or visble light in responsce by energetic particles
Light is detected and turned into an electral signal that can be read on a meter



# 17.1 Diagnosing Appendendicitis

White blood cell count
[[Radioactivity]] is emission of tiny particles of nuclei of certain atoms
Atoms that emit particles are [[Radioactive]]
Antibodies are labeled with radioactive atoms injected into bloodstream
Radioactivity is used to diagnose and treat many conditions

# 17.2 The Discovery of Radioactivity

# 17.5 Natural Radioactivity and Half-Life

Instability of atomic nuclei beyond Atomic Number 83, Bismuth

## Half-Life

Time it takes for half of the parent nuclide to become the daughter nuclide is the [[Half-Life]]
