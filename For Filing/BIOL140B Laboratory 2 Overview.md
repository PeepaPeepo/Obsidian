# P-Value

Insignificant past .5 

# Learning Objectives

Describe components and the proper use of light microscopes
explain how antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations demonstrate natural selection
describe the difference between phenotype and genotype
explain the use of multiple lines of evidence to test a hypothesis

# Disease Detectives

Poster activities tomorrow will be for studying for exam

## Mission

Identify microbe causing the infection
Track down infection to the srouce and detemrine if from hospital
find a cure

## Part I: Identify Microbe

Can be caused by virus, bacteria, a fungus, or parasite
Staphylococci

bacteria can make antibioitics to fight other bacteria

antibiotics are produced by microbes to kill other microbes
1928 by accident
alexander flemming 
mold that has penecillin
saves millions of life from infections
penicillin was much needed
unused portion of urine was filterd for it
mi use create super bacteria
[[Mega Plate]] containing bands of different concentrations of antibiotics
11 days to elolve into super mutation resiation
generaetion per 20 minutes
getting smarter about when to use antiboitis
do not use against colds or viruses, and non applicable uses 
antibacterial chemicals in soap and other commerical products
art with bacteria
bacterial division is just cloning itself

## Evidence: Antibiogram Data

Identify the microbe causing the infection
track dow nthe infection to determine source

MRSA 
did it come from an outside source or did it come from the hospital
Nosocomial infections that happen in clinical setting

[[Antibiogram Data]] is table that shows how it reacts to commonly prescirbed antibioitic compounds

# Sanger

how does sanger sequencing work
Fredrick sanger
defined stop to identfiy specific dna fragement
remove oxygen ion dinuclide
dideoxynucloetide and capillary electrophoresis
speed is inversly propotionately to mass
