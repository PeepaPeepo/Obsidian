[[Gastrulation]] is a process where the [[Blastula]] reforms itself into two or three layers, depending if the organism is [[Diploblasty|Diploblastic]] or [[Triploblasty]]. Gastrulation leads to the formation of two or three [[Germ Layers]]: [[Ectoderm]], [[Endoderm]], and [[Mesoderm]].

Each germ layer develops into their respective [[Organ Systems]].
