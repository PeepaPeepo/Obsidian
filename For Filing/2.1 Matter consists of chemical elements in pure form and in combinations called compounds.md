# Key Ideas

- Organisms are made of matter
- Matter is made up of molecules, which are made of atoms

# Elements and Compounds

- [[Elements]] are substances that cannot be broken down further by chemical reactions
- It is like a prime number
- There are 92 natural elements
- Element symbols are typically the first two letters of its name
	- Some are derived from German and Latin
- Sodium = Na = Natrium
- [[Compounds]] is a [[Substances]] that have two or more different elements that are combined in a fixed ratio
- Compounds have different characteristics than it's individual elements

## Table Salt

- $NaCl$
- Composed of $Na$ and $Cl$
- in a 1:1 ratio
- When chemically combine it creates table salt

# The Elements of Life

- 92 Natural elements
- 20-25% are [[Essential Elements]] that organisms need to live and reproduce
- Varies by species
	- Humans need 25
	- Plants need 17
- 4 Elements make up 96% of living matter
	- Oxygen $O$
	- Carbon $C$
	- Hydrogen $H$
	- Nitrogen $N$ 
- The rest are the following
	- Calcium $Ca$
	- Phosphorus $P$
	- Potassium $K$
	- Sulfur $S$
- [[Trace Elements]] are minimally needed by organisms
	- Iron $Fe$
	- Vertebrates need elements
		- Iodine $I$
		- hormones produced by thyroid gland
		- 0.15 mg is good for human thyroid

# Case Study: Evolution of Tolerance of Toxic Elements

- Species can adapt to toxic environments
- serpentine plants
- Serpentine is a compound mineral
	- Chromium
	- Nickel
	- Cobalt
- Can teach about natural selection
## How does table salt have emergent properties? (1.1)

Sodium and Chlorine are both individually dangerous, but when combined creates harmless table salt

## Are trace elements essential elements?

Yes, but not in large quantities

## If the trace element, Iron, is required for hemoglobin function, what would an Iron deficiency cause?

Poor hemoglobin blood transfer

## How can natural selection might contribute to evolutions of species that can tolerate serpentine soils.



## Elements in the Human Body

|Element|Symbol|Percentage of Body Mass (including water)|
|---|---|---|
|[[Oxygen]]|O|65.0%|
|[[Carbon]]|C|18.5%
|[[Hydrogen]]|H|9.5%
|[[Nitrogen]]|N|3.3%
|[[Calcium]]|Ca|1.5%
|[[Phosphorus]]|P|1.0%
|[[Potassium]]|K|0.4%
|[[Sulfur]]|S|0.3%
|[[Sodium]]|Na|0.2%
|[[Chlorine]]|Cl|0.2%
|[[Magnesium]]|Mg|0.1%
