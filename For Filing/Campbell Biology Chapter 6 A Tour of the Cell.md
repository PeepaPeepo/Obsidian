- Main ingredients are [[Glycoproteins]] and other [[Carbohydrates]]
	- Glycoproteins are proteins with carbohydrate covalently bonded to it
- Most abundant glycoprotein is [[Collagen]] which forms strong fibers outside the cells
- Accounts for 40$ of total protein in human body
- Collagen fibers are embedded in network woven out of [[Proteoglycans]] secreted by cells
	- Proteoglycan molecule consists of small core protein with many carbohydrate chains covalently attached, up to 95% carbs
- Large complexes can form when hundreds of proteoglycan molecules become attached to single long polysaccharide molecule
- Some cells are attached to ECM by ECM proteins such as [[Fibronectin]]

## Intermediate Filaments

## Centrioles and Centrosomes

- Allows chromosomes to be sperated for division
- Cetriole is a bundle
- 3 is centrosomes
- [[Mitosis]] is division of somatic cells 
- Tubes will extend from an MTOC 
	- microtublr organizing center
	- Starts at negative end and moves to positive end
- Constriction of a chromosome is a [[Centromene]]
- MTOC will connect to centromere
- Microtubules 
- Alpha and Beta Tubulin
- 9 + 2 arrangement
	- 9 Doublets
	- [[Dyneins]] allows for contraction
	- Chromosome non-disjunction
		- can cause down syndrome
		- Lack of separation of chromosome
		- [[Aneoploidy]]
- Why do cells divide
	- growth
	- replacement expiration
	- Why too much growth?
	- Cannot sustain itself with atp that is supplied
	- Trillion cells go through billions of atp
- Adherence
	- Signalling proteins
	- Activate that propogate through cytoplasm of cell
	- Cell receptor
		- Has ligand that is a like a trigger
	- Change will be detected on cytoplasmic side
	- Allows proteins to bind to it
	- Transvers a signal throughout the cell
	- Biochemical pathways
		- chain reaciton
		- cross talk
		- Eventually to a product end
		- Phenotype is a charactertisic of a cell or trait
			- Can occur in cytoplasm
			- occur in the nucleus
			- Happens in cytosol
				- Cytosol contains macromolecules
- Cytosol is viscous

## Adherent Proteins between cells forming tissues

- Cell is like a state with border
- Extracellular binding between tissues
- [[Extracellular Matrix]] ECM
- Extracellular proteins
- [[Peripheral Proteins]]
- Interactions with cytoskeleton can be involved in signalling 
- [[Tight Junctions]] caused by proteins
	- very alkene
	- Stomach cells have tight junctions
	- Endothelial cells
		- Make up arteries
		- veins
		- arterial
		- Venuals
		- lympthatic vessels
		- capillaries
			- thinnest part of blood cells
- [[Aherens Junctions]]
- [[Desmosome]]
	- Like spot welding
	- brings adjacent cells closer
	- A lot of proteins involved
	- Ensures tight connection
	- [[Cadherins]]
		- Adhere to the proteins
		- $Ca^{2+}$
- [[Gap Junctions]]
	- Called plasmoagatta
	- Allows transport of substances
	- Makes a donught like structure

## Extracelluar Matrix

- Web of proteins and carbohydrates at cell surface
	- outside plasma membrane
	- connected to cytoskeleton fibers
- [[Interstial Fluids]]
	- Bathes extracellular matrix
	- Allows reactions to take place
	- Some go back to lymp

Water is a bridge molecule
Its used for [[Hydrolysis]]

[[Mitochondria]]
