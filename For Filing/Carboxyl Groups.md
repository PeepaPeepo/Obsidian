$$\ce{ -COOH <=> - COO- + H+}$$
- $CO$ is the Carbonyl group, $\ce{ :C=O }$
- $\ce{ OH }$ is the Hydroxyl group, $\ce{ -OH }$
- A [[Functional Groups|functional group]] composed of a [[Carbonyl Groups]] bonded with a [[Hydroxyl Groups]] 
- Acts as an [[Acids]] because it can donate $\ce{ H+ }$
- The [[Polar Covalent Bonds|polar covalent bond]] in the Hydroxyl group gives the potential to donate $\ce{ H+ }$
- Any compounds that contains the Carboxyl Group are called [[Carboxylic Acid]] or Organic Acids
- Carboxyl groups can ionize by releasing the H from the Hydroxyl group
- The polarity of the bond increases
- Compounds with carboxyl groups have [[Hydrophilic]] centers, resulting in high melting points and boiling points
