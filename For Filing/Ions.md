- When an [[Atoms|Atom]] gains or loses an [[Electrons|electron]] or [[Protons|proton]], it becomes an [[Ions|ion]]
- The ratio of protons to electrons, or vice versa, determines how much charge an atom has
- The number of charges an ion has is dependent on every excess subatomic particle there is
- A surplus of electrons changes the atom into an [[Anions|anion]]
- A deficit of electrons changes the atom into a [[Cations|cation]]
- If the number of protons changed in an element, the element would change its identity
- Some atoms can gain partial charges based on [[Electronegativity]] of an element and its bonded atoms in a [[Polar Covalent Bonds]], but it is not an Ion
- The unbalance of a full integer of electrons can make ions
- Partially charged atoms are still neutrally charged
- Ion charges are notated as a superscripted + or - sign after an element
$$\ce{ Li->Li^+ + e^- }$$
- If an ion has multiple charges, the charge symbol is pre-fixed with the number of charges
$$\ce{ H^{2+} }$$

- Elements on the left of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]] tend to lose [[Electrons]]
- Elements on the right of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]] tend to gain [[Electrons]]
