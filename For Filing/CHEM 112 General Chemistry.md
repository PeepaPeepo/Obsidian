## Laboratory 1

Conductimetric Titration of Ba(OH)2


Sodium Chloride
NaCl(s)
Dissolve into (aq)
Na+ + Cl - + H2O

[[Electrolytes]] can produce conductivity 

$\ce{ Ba(OH)2 (aq) + HCl (aq) -> BaCl_{2}(s) + H_{2}O}$

End Point vs Eqivalencce Point

Evquivalence point is perfectly equaa
End point is not exact
