[[Telomeres]] are found at the termini of [[Chromosomes]] and keep the ends of the [[Chromosomes]] from attaching to other one. Human [[Telomeres]] consists of around 2000 repeats of the sequence:

$$\ce{ 5'\dots GGTTAG\dots 3' }$$

When [[DNA Replication]] almost finishes, the [[Daughter Strands]] will have shortened [[Telomeres]]. [[Teleomerase]] are [[Enzymes]] that add [[Telomeres]] repeat sequences to 3' end of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] sequences to complete replication.
