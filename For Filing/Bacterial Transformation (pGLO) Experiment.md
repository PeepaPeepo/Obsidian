# Introduction

- Initiate [[Bacterial Transformation]]
	- allows genetic information to be introduced into a bacterial cell through the use of [[Plasmids]]
		- Circular DNA molecule with three genes
		- Naturally occurs
		- Can exists Extra-chromosomally
		- Have genetic information
		- Used as vectors or vehicle in order to carry genetic information
- Using starter plates with non-pathogenic [[Escherichia Coli]], each group should transform one sample of bacteria +DNA
- Maintaining -DNA
- The strain of bacteria is sensitive to [[Ampicillin]]; it will kill [[Escherichia Coli]]
- To transform +DNA, plasmid ([[pGLO]]) will be added
- Process has low efficiency, antibioitic resistances must be used

# Materials and Methods

## Part 1: Bacterial Transformation via the pGLO Plasmid

09/19/2023

1. Acquired two 1.5 mL [[Microcentrifuge Tubes]], labelled each tube as "+DNA" and "-DNA" with initials and date
2. Added 250 uL of transformation solution $\ce{ CaCl_{2} }$
3. Placed both tubes in ice for 2 min
4. Added one bacterial colony into the +DNA tube via circular end of a sterile loop, mixed well, placed back on ice
5. Added one bacterial colony into the -DNA tube via circular end of a new sterile loop, mixed well, placed back on ice
6. Added 20 uL [[Plasmids|plasmid]] ([[pGLO]]) in to +DNA tube
7. Iced both tubes for 10 minutes
8. Acquired 4 mini gar plates, labelled on gel side with the following ID's
	1. Black Line L
		1. B/-DNA/Initials/Date
	2. Black/bluelines 
		1. LB/Amp/-DNA
	3. Black/Blue Lines
		1. LB/Amp/+DNA/Intials/Date
	4. Black/Blue/Red lines
		1. LB/AMp/Ara/+DNA/Initials/Date
9. Moved beaker with ice closer to hot water bath. Placed both tubes in hot water at $42^oC$ for 50 s for heat shock. Placed back on ice after 2 minutes.
10. Add 250 uL of LB broth into each tube. [[Luria Bertani Broth]] provides nutrition and revitalizes the bacterial cell
11. Incubated both tubes for 10 minutes
12. Transferred samples with following parameters
	1. 100 uL of -DNA into LB/-DNA (black line)
	2. 100 uL of -DNA into LB/Amp/-DNA (black and blue lines)
	3. 100 uL of +DNA into LB/Amp/+DNA (Black and blue lines)
	4. 100 uL of +DNA into LB/Amp/Ara/+DNA
13. Spread bacteria using [[Streak Plate Method]], using new sterile loop per plate
14. Parafilmed each plate and stacked, secured with lab tape. Initialled with initials and date, name of experiment
15. Incubated plates upside down at $37^oC$ for next Lab day

- Molarity is moles in a liquid

$$\ce{ Molarity=\frac{Mole}{Liter} }$$
$$M_{1}V_{1}=M_{2}V_{2}$$
$$C_{1}V_{1}=C_{2}V_{2}$$
