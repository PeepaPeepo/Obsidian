$\ce{ \Delta S_{univ} = \Delta S_{sys} + \Delta S_{Surr} }$

$\ce{ \Delta S = 0 }$ reversible, non spontaneous
$\ce{ \Delta S > 0 }$ irreversible, spontaneous and favorable

The total [[Entropy]] change of the universe must be positive for a

process to be [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]]. 

The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] states that every [[Energy]] transfer or transformation increases the [[Entropy]] of the universe.
