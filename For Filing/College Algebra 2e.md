## 1.1 Real Numbers: Algebra Essentials

### Classifying a real Number

[[Natural Numbers]] are for enumerating numbers {1, 2, 3...}
Set of [[Whole Numbers]] is [[Natural Numbers]] including 0
[[Integers]] add opposite of [[Natural Numbers]] to [[Whole Numbers]]

[[Integers]] include [[Natural Numbers]] and [[Whole Numbers]]
[[Rational numbers]] are fractions where the denominator cannot be zero
	They are fractions or [[Quotients]]
	Natural numbers, whole numbers, and integers are rational numbers with denominator of 1 
	Can be in decimal form

### Irrational Numbers

[[Irrational numbers]] cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers

### Real Numbers

Set of rational and irrational numbers make [[real number]]

### Performing Calculations Using the Order of Operations

[[Exponential notation]] $a^n$ means the number is used as a factor $n$ times
a is the [[Base]] and n is the [[Exponents]]
[[Order of Operations]] containers are used to group numbers. Fraciton bars, radicals, and absolute value bars are treated as grouping symbols
PEMDAS

### Using Properties of Real Numbers

[[Commutative property of addition]] numbers may be added in any order

[[Commutative property of multiplication]] numbers can be multiplied in any order

[[Associative property of multiplication]] it does not matter the grouping of numbers when multiplying

[[Associative property of addition]] shows that numbers can be grouped in any way

[[Distributive property]] states that a product of a factor times a sum is the sum of the factor times each term in the sum 

[[Identity property of addition]] when adding 0, the result is the original number

[[identity proper of multiplication]] when multiplied by 1, the original number occurs

[[Inverse property of addition]] positive original and negative version cancels out

[[Inverse property of multiplication]] for every real number when multiplied by its reciprocal

### Evaluating Algebraic Expression

[[Constant]] values do not vary
[[Variables]] does
[[Algebraic expression]] is a collection of constants and variables joined by the algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

### Formulas

An [[Equation]] is a mathematical statement indicating two expressions are equal

==[[Formula]] is an equation expressing a relationship between constant and variable quantities==

## 1.2 Exponents and Scientific Notation

### Product rule of exponents

same bases with powers that are multiply add their exponents together

$x^3+x^3=x^6$ 

The bases work with real numbers 

### Quotient rules

Same bases with powers when divided subtract exponents
Numerating base with power must be greater than the denominator's power

### Using the Power Rule of Exponents

When base and exponent is raised to a power, the powers are multiplied

### Using the zero exponent rule of exponents

Exponents of 0 leads to product of 1

### Using the Negative rule of Exponents

Difference of powers in a fraction can lead to a negative exponent
Imagine if reciprocal

$a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$

$a^{n} = \frac{1}{a^{-n}}$

### Finding the power of a product

power of a product rule of exponent can distribute exponents to each of the bases in a group

$(pq)^3=p^3*q^3$

### Finding Power of a quotient

Same thing applies to rational numbers

$\left( \frac{f^2}{e^2} \right)^7=\frac{f^{14}}{e^{14}}$
