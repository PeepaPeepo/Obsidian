[[Cellulose]] is a [[Polysaccharides|polysaccharide]] where its [[Glucose]] [[Monomers]] are in $\beta$ orientations when forming a [[Glycosidic Linkages|glycosidic link]]. Although they have the same 1' - 4' links like starch, the staggering of the existing [[Hydroxyl Groups|Hydroxyl Groups]] lines up will with neighboring parallel [[Polymers]] forming [[Hydrogen Bonds]]. The bonding between the cellulose molecules make up units called [[Microfibrils]]. 

[[Enzymatic Proteins]] that [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] $\alpha$ linkages cannot hydrolyze $\beta$ linkages.
