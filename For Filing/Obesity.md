Lack of fat allows muscle definition
No padding on body
Pins and needles feeling
Troy was born with normal amount of at
Eats a lot until it hurt
Blood is filled with fat and cholesterol
	Symptoms of obesity
[[Lipodystrophy]] absolute lack of fat
Excess energy has no where to go
Excess calories built up in liver
Gene for Hormone regulating biological function found
[[Leptin]] from 
Leptos Thin Green
Normal Fat cell produces leptin to signal hypothalamus
High levels tells brain that it is full
Lack of it says hungry
Prevents liver build up of calories

[[Leptin]] and Obesity
Lack of will power
Lifestyle/environment
Biology and genes

A lot of evidence for biology
Systematically observe twins
Monozyogote
Dizoygote
Fraternal half have the genes vs Identical
Obesity is more heritable 
70-80% of bodyweight scenarios can be based on genes
Increased appetite
Obesity from inbred families
Might be missing horomone, Leptin
Absence lead to eating more
Lack of signal leads to simulation to eating more
Hormonal loop of leptin
Low leptin level leads to eating more
Bing eating can suppress level production
CCK [[Cholecystokinin]] suppression of appetite
Intestinal hormone
CCK Found in brain
Suggested homormone from brain and gut managed appetite 
Gut brain axis
CCK in OB mouse
Single genetic defect in OB Mouse
Maybe missing CCK 
But CCK values were within normal limits
Looked for Location of CCK vs OB Gene
OB was in CHromosone 6 and not CHromosome 9 for CCK

Positional Cloning
Increased RNA in OB animal shows in [[Agarose Gel Electrophoresis]]
Leptin mutations are rare
10-15% morbid obesity is affected by leptin

# [Leptin vs. Ghrelin: How Hormones Control Your Appetite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci1hw3Y0QEY)

Maria Conley MD

Constant access to high sugar low fiber food
vs Ancestral lack of food

[[Hypothalamus]] control eating
Secretes several [[Hormones]]
Signaled from other chemicals from body
Nerves send electrial signals from 
[[Grelin]] produced and release by stomach when empty 
[[Leptin]] satiety hormon released from fat cells, tells how much body fat is stored
Stored in White Fat Cells, leptin decrease when calories are decreased
Leptin resistance from hormone
Hypothalamus respeond blood level of ghrelin
Satiety hormone from fat cells and insuilin levels of pancrease
Brain monitors blood levels of glucose and fat
Being Hungry vs wanting to eat
Sensation is under hormonal control
Pleasure center releases dopamine such as ice cream 
Body Clock in food preps to time of day
6am empty stomach releases ghrelin
Breakfast eatng, fat cells release leptin
Brain detects lunchtime and insulin is released and feel hungry
Eat again leptin goes up
Dopamine in brain makes crave for chocolate 
Stomach is empty at dinner, grelin is released, hung

# The Hunger Genes: Pathways to Obesity

## Introduction

Obesity is defined as increase of fat mass that is adversely affects health
BMI as surrogate marker
WHO def is 30Kg/m^2 
30% american are obese 
10-20% EU ob
As BMI increase, risk of 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular dieases increase
Increase in childhood obesity
	Leads to type II diabetes mellitus in adolescents
Society association with disability, mortality, and health cost
Individual problems including sleep disturbance, breathing difficulties, joint and mobility issues, social stigma, affecet education and jobs

## Obesity as a disorder of energy homeostasis 

Physiological studies in healthy normal weight have shown total energy expenditure decreases by average of 10% with acute caloric restriction and increases with excess

Humans' homeostatic regulation is easily overwhelmed by external stimuli
In free food, people were able to exceed 150% of energy requirement

Some are able to resist weight change with overeating

## Environmental factors drive the rise in obesity prevalence

Increase of obesity in developing countries with urbanization
Sedentary lifestyles due to lack of physical activity at work
Abundance of available and nutrient rich food

Second generation migrants to the US from all ethnic groups are heavier than their parents who migrated

Some ethnic groups are more prone to gaining weight in obesogenic environments

## Individual Susceptibility to weight gain is highly variable-role of genetic factors 

Human adiposity is influenced by genetic, developmental, behavioral, and environmental influences

Twin and adoption studies
Studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins who live together and apart
High heritability of phenotypes related to obesity support contribution of genetic factors
[[Thrifty gene hypothesis]] suggest genetic variants that favor efficient food collection and fat deposition to survive periods of famine and that fat deposition to survive periods of famine
	Living in easy availability of food causes disadvantage

## Hypothalamic Circuits Regulating Energy Homeostasis 

Hypothalamus is involved with regulation of body weight and other homeostatic functions

Set functions to maintain parameters such as body temp, electrolyte balance, sleep, and energy

Activate autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral outputs

## Molecular Characterization of the Circuits Involved win Energy Homeostasis

[[Leptin]] deficiency can caused obesity
ob/ob mice characterized by increased food intake, reduced energy expenditure, hypogonadism, low thyroid hormone levels, elevated levels of corticosterone, and low blood pressure 
Leptin injection proves it is a regulator

## Leptin-A Master regulator of human energy homeostasis

leptin mRNA concentration in adipose tissue and serum leptin concentrations correlated positively and closely to fat mass

Leptin's role is to signal nutritional depletion, fasting or weight loss lead to fall in leptin levels and it triggers changes in energy intake, energy expenditure, and neuroendocrine function in order to maintain energy homeostasis

Low leptin means eat more, high leptin means stop
if leptin is not made, eat more keeps going 
if resist leptin, eat more keeps going

loss of function mutations can reduce production, secretion, or effectiveness of leptin
or distrupt the receptor
Disorders are rare, 1 -5 %
[[Lipodystrophic syndrome]] causes leptin deficiency due to loss of adipose tissue

Impaired leptin characterized by intense drive to eat, [[Hyperphagia]], reduced sympathetic tone, mild hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and impaird T cell immunity
	Revirsed with leptin administartion of recombininat human leptin
Driver of increase blood pressure

Leptin mediates to the long form of the receptor expressed on hyptohalamic neuronal populations in the arcuate necleus of the hyptohalamus and other regions
	Homozygous mutations distrupt that expression, binding, and signaling
SRC Honolgy 2 B Adaptor Protein 1 related to sensitivity of leptin

## Leptin as a Therapeutic Agent

[[Metreleptin]] is effective in patients with no leptin working
FDA Apporved
minimal efficacy for common forms of obesity

## Melanocortin Peptides and Their Receptors 

Leptin stimulates primary neurons 
	express pro-opiomelanocortin POMC
Leptin signaling modulates energy balance through combination of melanocortin-dependent and indepdendent pathways
Hyptohalamic pathways ineract with other brain centers to coordinate energy intake and energy expendeiture

Homozygous null mutations in POMC result in severe obesity
Heterozygous loss of function mutations in alpha nad beta melanocyte stimulating hormone significatly increase obesity risk
Distruption of Mc4r leads to increased food intake and other 
Heterozygous MC4R Mutations are found in 2% - 5% of people with childhood onset obesity

## Processing and Trafficking of Melanocortin Peptides and Receptors

Melanocortin peptides are processed by enzymes including [[Prohormone convertase 1]] which cleaves POMC into ACTH into alpha MSH by carboypeptidase

impaired POMC processing may contribute to obesity

## Development and Maintenance of Neural Circuits invovled in Eating behavior

Peripheral signals such as leptin can modulate the developement and maintenace of neural circuits and ability to adap signaling by altering synaptic inputs

brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF is important in energy balance and anxiety and aggression

Mice with BDNF that was deleted post natally are obese wit hhyperphagia

## Neural Circuits Involved in eating Behavior

High fat diets are preferentially over consumed
Food reward considred encoded by distincy nerual substrates
[[Mesoaccumbens dopamine system]], increase or decrease the incentive values of food depending on energy requirements
==Pleasurable effects of food is powerful motivating force that can override homeostatic satiety signals==
Single meal of increased portion can trigger increased food intake over several days

## Human Brain Imaging Studies - Insights into Food Reward

functional MRI permit measurement of blood oxygen level dependet signals 
Leptin deficient humans images of food are associated with marked increase in neuronal activation in ventral straiatum

Response was normalized with leptin treatment

ventral striatum does not directly encode the liking but the wanting
Obese people with MC4R mutatiosn have a preserved pattern of activation of the reward system to visual food cues

$\mu$-opioid receptor system is incharge of liking food
bupropion inhibits reuptake of dopamine and is approved treatment of obesity by FDA

## Taste and Food Preference

Heritability esitmates 30 - 50% for pleasantness, consumption, and craving for sweets

refined sugars promotes larger meal sizes, less postprandial satiety, and greater caloric intake

## Gut-Derived Satiety Signals

[[Ghrelin]] is scecreted from gut entero-endocrine cells
Gut peptides modulate food intake when admistered acutely in humans
[[Satiation]] determines meal terimination and satiety, persistence of fullness that determines next meal time are heritable

## Targeting Energy Expenditure

Very few genes have been shown to modulate [[Basal Metabolic Rate]] BMR
Reduced BMR reported in ob people with loss of function mutations
Almost all KSR2 vairents identified in obese individuals
Activation of brown adipose tissue as treatment
Simulation with thermogensis and pharmacological simulation of processes

## Building an Integrated view of the pathways that regulate energy homeostasis


[[Arcuate Nucleus]] is signal to produced ACTH or NPY
Leptin presence inhibits 
Leptin causes stimulation of CRH production

PVN with NPY leads in to increases in fat, mr

CRH Production is promoted when leptin is detected
	Responsible for decreasing feeding
Neuropeptide is deactivated when leptin is detected
	NPY is responsible for increased feeding, decrease energy expenditure
	Increased fat production

ob/ob produces non working leptin
db/db has mutated receptor
