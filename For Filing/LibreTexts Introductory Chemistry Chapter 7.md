# 7.2 Evidence of a Chemical Reaction

[[Chemical Reactions]] are the processes where one or more substances change into one or more new different [[Substances]].

[[Chemical Reactions]] produce [[Chemical Changes]], and the make one or more types of matter that different from the [[Reactants]].

# 7.3 The Chemical Equation

# Learning Objectives

- Identify [[Reactants]] and [[Products]] in any [[Chemical Equations]]
- Convert word equations into chemical equations
- Using common symbols such as (s), (l), (g), and (aq)

# Reactants and Products

[[Reactants]] are substances that exist before a reaction. [[Products]] are the outcomes of reactants undergoing chemical changes.

[[Reactants]] can be placed into a [[Reaction Vessel]] and a [[Chemical Reactions]] may take place and produce [[Products]].

# Writing Chemical Equations

[[Chemical Equations]] place [[Reactants]] before an $\ce{ -> }$ and [[Products]] are placed afterwards. There are certain notations that are involved in chemical equations.

$+$ separates multiple [[Products]] and [[Reactants]]
$\ce{ -> }$ is a [[Yield Signs]], and separates reactants from products
$\ce{ <=> }$ is a reversible yield sign
$\ce{ ->[Pt] }$ formula written above is used as [[Catalysts]] in reaction
$\ce{ ->[\Delta] }$ Delta over arrow means reaction is being heated.
$(s)$ Solid state
$(l)$ Liquid State
$(g)$ Gas State
$(aq)$ Aqueous
