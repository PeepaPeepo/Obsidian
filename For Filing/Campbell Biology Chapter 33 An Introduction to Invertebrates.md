[[Animalia]] has 1.3 known species
[[Invertebrates]] lack a backbone, and account for over 95% known animal species
THey occupy almost every habitat on earth

## Exploring invertebrate Diverisity

[[Porifera]] are sessile filter feeders that lack ture tissues
[[Cnidaria]] radially symmetrical, diploblastic animals have ggastrovascular

# Concept 33.2 Cnidarians are an ancient phylum of eumetazoans

All animals that arent sponges are [[Eumetazoans]], animals with true tissues
Oldest is [[Cnidaria]]
includes sessile and motile forms including corals, hydras, sea anemones, and sea jellies
[[Diploblasty]] with [[Radially Symmetrical Animals]]
Sac with central digestive

[[Body Plans]], [[Sessile Polyp]] and [[Motile Medusa]]
[[Polyps]] adhere to substrate by abora end of the body
[[Medusa]] is free swimming form that has a bell shaped body with the mouth on the underside
Cnidarians are predators that uses tentacle armed with [[Cnidocytes]] used in defense and capture
[[Nematocysts]] organnelle ethat stings
Clades within [[Medusozoa]] and [[Anthozoa]]
Jellies, box jellies,freshwater hydra
Athozoans occur as polyps. include sea anemomnes and coral
Symbiosis with algae
Life cycle of hydrozoan obelia
Developing polyp larva 
Medusa 2n diploid from 1n male or female
Polyps form habitat for species
reefs are destroed by pollution
coral bleaching of temperature

## Lophotrochoza

Named after morpholopgy
[[Platyhelminthes]] includes flatworms that live in marine fresh water and damp habitats
Parasites such as [[Flukes]] and [[Tapeworms]]
Doroventrally flattened acoelomates
Gastrovascular cavity branches throughout the body
Flat body increases suface area placing all cells close to water
Diffuses nutrientts

[[Flatworms]] have two lineages [[Catenulida]] 
[[Planarians]] are free living
Have eye spot 
Centralized nervous system
Asexual and regenerative

## Parastic Species

More than half of [[Rhabditophorans]] are parasites
[[Trematodes]] have diverse hosts
[[Blood Flukes]] causes [[Schistosomiasis]] 

## Tapeworms

parasites of mostly vertebrates
Do not have a mouth or gastrovascular acivtry
[[Scolex]] at anterior end contains suckers and hooks for attaching the hosts
[[Proglottids]] are units contain sex organs and form a ribbon behind the scolex
Humans acquire larvae encysted in the muscle of the intermediate hosts by eating undercooked meat

[[Rotifers]] are tiny animals that inhabit freshwater, marine and damp soil habitats
SMaller than any protests
Crown of cilia draw water and food particles called [[Trophi]]
[[Alimentary Canal]]
[[[Hemocoel]]] functions as hydrostatic skeleton
[[Parthenogensis]] females produce female offspring from unfertilized eggs
Can reproduce sexually under 

[[Acanthocephalans]] are sexually reproducing parasties of vertebrates
Lack a comlete digestive tract and are less than 20 cm long
[[Proboscis]]
All are parasites with compelx life cycles
Some species manipulate the intermedia hosts behavroir to increase transmission to final hosts
New Zealand mud crabs move to areas

[[Ectoprocts]] and [[Brachiopods]]
Share several traits

[[Lophophore]] a crown of ciliated tentalces around their mouth
U shaped alimentary canal
Absense of distinct head
[[Coelom]] 
Ectoprocta are ssiele colonial animals that superficially resemble clumps of moss
[[Brachiopods]] resembal cclams and other 
But have dorsal and ventral rather than lateral
Most attached to sea flor with stocks

[[Phylum Mollusca]] 
INcludes snails, slugs, oysters and clamps, octopuses and squids
Most molluscus are marine, 
Soft bodies with shells
Muscular Foot
Visceral Mass
Mantle a fold of tissue draping over the visceral mass that secrest hte shell
[[Mantle Cavity]] houses gills, anus, and extory pores
Feed using [[Radula]] that scrapes off food
Most have separated sexes
Ciliated larval stage called [[Trochophore]]
Eigh major classes
[[Plyplacophora]]
[[Gastropoda]]
[[Bivalvia]]
[[Chitons]] are marine animals with oval shaped bodies and a shell made of eight dorsal plates
Food grips on rock
Radula used to scrape algae off the surface

[[Gastropods]] marine freshwater 
Gastropods have single sprialed shell
Slowly using cilia or rippling motion of the foot
Terrestial snails lack gills
[[Bivalvia]] aquatic includes clams, oysters, mussles, and scallops
Shell divdied into two hinged halves drawn together by [[Adductor Muscles]]
No head or radula
Some have sensory tentacles along edge of their mantel
Sedentary and achored

[[Cephalopoda]] are active marine predators with beak like jaws by tentacles
Poisonous saliva
Food is modified into muscular excurrent sipon and part of the tentacles
Water is draw into acivty and shot out throug hexcurrent for rapid movement
Only molluscs with closed circulatory system
Sense organs and complex brain
Shelled ones are [[Ammonites]] were once the dominant invertebrate predators of the seas
Exttinc with creaceous period
Most squid spcies are less than 75 cm long
Giant squid [[Archieuthis dux]]

MOlluscs have largest number of odocumented among animals
Bivalves area terrestial gastropods are the threatended
Treats to freshwater and terrestial molllusics

[[Annelids]] included segmented worms that live in marine 
Have coelom and range from less than 1 mm to more than 3 m in length
two clades
Errantia

[[Errantia]] is large and diverse mostly marine
Swimmers, crawlers or burrowers
Developed jaws used for predation
[[Parapodia]] used for motility and breathing

[[Sedentarians]] tend to be less mobile than errantians
Burrow slowly into substrate
Earthworms and leeches are included in this clade

All in [[Lophotrochozoa]] 
Leeches inhabit fresh water
Lives in moist vegetration
Most leeches are predators of invertebrates
Parasitic leeches slit the skin of host and secrete anesthetic
[[Hirudin]] prevents coagulation

[[Earthworms]] eat through soil extracting nutrients undigested material as feceal castings
Important in tilling, aerating, and improving texture of soils

# How Can we make sense of the great number and morphological diversity of invertebrates?

[[Animalia]] have 1.3 known species
[[Invertebrates]] make up 95% of the known
Occupies almost every habitat on earth
