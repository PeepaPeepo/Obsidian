# Overview

- [[Spectroscopy]] is the study of how light and matter interact
- Light can be absorbed, scattered, or pass through an object
- Eyes can detect scattered light from reflections off other matter
- Allows chemists to see atoms and molecules
- [[Spectrophotometry]] is a technique used to determine concentration of unknown solution
- Light Absorbance = (A)
- The absorbance is obtained by shining a light on a sample and measure the light that gets through as percentage of amount of [[Incident Light]] (percent transmission, %T)

$$\ce{ A=-\log\left( \frac{\%T}{100\%} \right) }$$
- Absorbance of a solution and its concentration obey a simple linear relationship known as [[Beer Lambert Law]]

$$A=\epsilon lc$$

## Part II Spectrophotometric Determination of an Unknown # Concentration

# Calculations

# 09/26/2023 Lecture

## Objective

- Determine concentration of unknown solution
- Part I Light and color
	- Distinguish between light that is absorbed versus light that is scattered or transmitted
	- Complementary colors are absorbed and percieved colors are reflected and recived into sensors
- Part II 
	- Determine the concentration of an unknown solution
	- SpectroVis Plus

## Overview

- Spectrometers use a light source that pass a controlled intensity of light
- Amount of light absorbed is logarithmically related to the ratio of measured light intensity and initial light intensity
- $$A=\epsilon bc$$
- A is light absorbed at the given wavelength
- B path length
- $\epsilon$ molar absorptivity/extinction coefficient
- c concentration of the FeSCN2+ complext in solution
- Dyes to be used in experiment display distinct colors in the visible region so we will be able to use the [[Beer Lambert Law]]
- $\ce{ A = \epsilon bC }$
- Concentration is in volume fraction

## Part 1

- Your lab instructor will show how to use it
- particular color in the visible spectrum
- estimate its wavelength and record the value in µm
- Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet
- Measure absorbtption of three available food coloring solutions
- Not and record the wavelengths at which the maximum absorbance occurs, $\lambda_{max}$ if there is more than one peak, note and record lambda max for the smalle peak as well
- Record the peaks of the graph
- Colors corresponding to the peak are recored as color absorbed at lambda max
- Color is measured by wavelength in µm

## Part  2

- Starting with teh stock solution, prepare the 5 solutions listed in table 2 by dilution
- $$v\ce{ olume fraction=  \frac{volume of stock}{volume of solution} }$$
- Use distilled water
- Volume fraction in decimal
- Measure and record absorbance of the standard at the wavelength where the absorption spectrum is maximum lambda max
- Dye colors should gree or red
- Plot data with the concentration along the horizonatal axis and athe absorbance along the vertical axis
- construct calibration curve by finding the straight line that fits the data the best
- Slope function
- $y=mx+b$
- $a+mc+b$
	- y is absorbance
	- m slop
	- abs is absorbance of unknown
- $abs=mc+b$
