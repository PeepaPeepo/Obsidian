[[Glycogen]] is a [[Polysaccharides|polysaccharide]], a [[Polymers|polymer]] made of [[Glucose]] [[Monomers|monomers]], that is extensively branched and stored in liver and muscle [[Cells]] in [[Vertebrata]] to be used as [[Energy]] later. The polymer branches out similarly to [[Amylopectin]], but more extensive to expose more ends that can be easily [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] when in need of energy. Glycogen is quickly expended by [[Animalia]], in about a day it can be depleted.

The monomers of glycogen are structurally similar [[Amylopectin]], but branches more frequently around 8 - 12 monomers between branches. The branches are also shorter compared to [[Amylopectin]]'s branches. This implies that glycogen is formed by [[Glucose]] monomers with alpha linkages at 1' - 4' with branches with 1' - 6' linkages every 8 - 12 monomers.
