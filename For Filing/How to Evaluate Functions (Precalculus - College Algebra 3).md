# Goals

How to evaluate for different expression
Composition of Functions
Evaluate a function takes a function and replaces independent variable with something that is a number or even an expression
What are times that cannot plugin a number? 
Exploring [[Difference Quotient]]
Why do we have multiple notations for functions?

The following notations means the same

```
y=-7x+5
f(x)=-7x+5

y=(3/2)x-1
g(x)=(3/2)x-1
```

It's read as 'Y' equals or "f of x"=

Function notation helps distinguish it as a function
It helps clearly identify from a visual perspective

Function can be written as f(2) meaning that x is replaced with 2
x can also be stated as x = 2

f(x)=-9

# Problems

Function problems can be written as the following

```
h(x)=-2x^2+x-1
h(-1)=
h(-x)=
x(x+1)=
```

function of x=-2x^2...
solve for the following inputs(-1, -x, (x+1))

How to write functions to evaluate properly
	Plug in numbers
Variable is the only replaceable 

h(x)=-2( )^2 + ( )-1 

Parenthesis can maintain equations well
Follow [[Order of Operations]]

When solving for functions the answer are ordered pairs 

[[Even and Odd Functions]]

Sqrt of 0 is zero and it's a real number

[[Distributive property]]
[[Difference Quotient]]

Negatives in square roots are problematic, but not in cubes
Negative radicans are bad
It's impossible to divide by zero

```
0/4 - valid
4/0 - invalid
```

Outputs need to be real numbers
Square roots and 0 denominators will cause problems
