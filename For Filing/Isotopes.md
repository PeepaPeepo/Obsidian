- An [[Isotopes|isotope]] is a variation of an element where its [[Neutrons|Neutron]] count is different from it's common occurring count
- Some isotope neutron counts are unstable in excess an can separate and emit as radioactive energy
- An [[Elements]] will maintain its identity so long as its [[Protons|Proton]] count stays the same 
- Some isotopes are utilized in the medical field as tracers for its safe radioactive properties
- Unstable [[Radioactive Isotope]] has its atomic nucleaus decay, with [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]] breaking off
- It changes the identity of the [[Parent Nuclei]] because the change of protons
- [[Daughter Nuclei]] that comes from the parent can be a stable or unstable isotope of a different element
