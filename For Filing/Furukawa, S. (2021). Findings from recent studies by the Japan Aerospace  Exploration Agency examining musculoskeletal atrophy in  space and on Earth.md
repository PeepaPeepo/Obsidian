1. Bone and Skeletal muscles are constantly remodeling, bone remodeling performed by building osteoblasts and bone resorbing osteoclasts.
1. Maintenance of muscle mass is a balance between cellular protein synthesis and catabolism
1. Mass can be altered in increased or decreased loading which follows the use it lose it concept (wolff's law)
1. Microgravity leads to increased ratio of fast-twitch to slow twitch muscle
1. Experiments show increase degradation of fast-type myosin heavy chain protein and increase increased protease expression in atrophied gastrocnemius muscles of neonatal rats
2. Space flight was found to stimulate the ubiquitination of proteins such as myosin heavy chain, and accumulation of myosin heavy chain degradation fragments in muscle *CHECK REFERENCE 12*
6. Preventing disuse atrophy can be done by exercise that decreases slow-twitch-fiber size in soleus muscle
6. Muscle mass gain is correlated with expression level of microRNA miR-378 REFERENCE 71, 72
6. Positively correlated with upregulation of mechanical-growth factor and myogenin gene expression
6. DNA methylation is affected by resistance training
