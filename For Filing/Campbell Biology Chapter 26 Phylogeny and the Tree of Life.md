Phylogenic Trees

Traits shared due to common ancestry are used to classify organisms into groups that refelect their evolutionary history

# Concept 26.1 Phylogenies show evolutionary relationships

[[Phylogeny]] is the evolutionary history of a species or group of [[Species]]
[[Systematics]] is a discipline focused on classifying organisms and determining their evolutionary relationships


## Binomial Nomenclature

[[Carolus Linnaeus]]
[[Binomial]] is the two part format of lat scientific names
The first part of the name is [[Genus]] the species belongs to
Second part is the [[Specific Epithet]] that is unique per species
First part is the [[Genus]] then specific [[Epithet]]
First letter of genus is captialized and the entire name is italicized
New names are latinized
It can be any name with a latin ending
the first letter of the genus is capitalize  the entire species name is italicized

[[Taxonomic Groups]] [[Domains]], [[Kingdoms]], [[Phyla]], [[Classes]], [[Orders]], [[Families]], [[Genus]], [[Species]]
Each level is a [[Taxon]]

Systematists have proposed classification based on evolutionary relationships

branch point represents teh divergence of two evolutionary lineages from a common ancestor
evolutionary lineage is a sequence of ancestral organisms leading to a particular descendant taxon

Sister Taxa share a common ancestor

# Parts of a Phylogenetic Tree

[[Common Ancestors]]
[[Evolutionary Lineages]]
[[Sister Taxa]]
[[Rooted]]
[[Basal Taxon]] lineage that diversges from all members of the group early in histroy of the group is called 
Phylogenetic trees do not show when they evlovle
Cannot assume a taxon 

# Applying Phylogenies

# Concept 26.2 Phylogenies are inferred from morphological and molecular data

[[Morphology]], [[Genes]], and [[Biochemistry]]
Features resulting fro common acnestry are useful
Phenotpyic and genetic similarities due to shard ancesstry called [[Homology]]
Organism with similar morphology or DNA sequences are likely to be more closely related thant those who vastly differen't structured 

## Evaluating Molecular Homologies

[[Nucleotide-Pair Insertion Deletions]] can cause mutations via Frame shifts when not in multiples of 3

[[Coincidental Matches]] can happen between unrelated organisms

# Concept 26.3 SHared characters are used to construct phylogenetic trees

Identify homologous characetsr to make phylogeny

## Cladistics

[[Monophyletic Groups]]
[[Paraphyletic Groups]]
[[Polyphyletic Groups]]

# Shared Ancestral and Shared Derived Characters

[[Shared Ancestral Characters]] character that originated in the ancestor of the taxon
[[Shared Derived Characters]] is evolutionary novelty uniqe to a particular clade
It is relative

## Inferring Phylogenies Using Derived Characters

[[Outgroup]] us a species or group of species cloesly related to, but not part of the gorup of species being studied

[[Ingroup]] is compared with outgroup differenetiated

## Phylogenetic Trees with Proportional Branch Lengths

branch lengths reflect [[Number of Genetic Changes]]
Some branch length are proportional to time
Fossile data is ued to place branch points in the context of geological time

## Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood

[[Maximum Parsimony]] assumes the most likely tree is the one that requires the fewest evolutionary events, appearance of shared derived characters, basedo n DNA is the fewest base changes 
[[Maximum Likelihood]] identifies the tree most likely have produced a given set of DNA data based on probabiliy rules about how DNA changes over time

## Phylogentic Trees as Hypotheses

[[Phylogenetic Bracketing]] predics that features shared by two closely related groups will be present in ther ancestors and all its descnendatns
Used to make predictions about [[Dinosaurs]]

# Concept 26.4: An Organisms evolutionary history is documented in its genome

molecular comparisons can be used to deduce relatednes between groups that are morpholgically dissimilar or poorly represented in the fossile reocrd

Different genes can evolve at different rate in tsame lineaege
DNA coding for ribosomal rna changes slowly
Mitochondrial DNA evolves relatively rapidly

# Gene Duplications and Gene Families

[[Gene Duplications]] increases the number of genes in the [[Genomes]] providing more opportunites for evolutionary change
Repeated gene duplications result in [[Gene Families]]. groups of related genes within a Genome
[[Homologous Genes]]: Orthoologous and paralogous genes
[[Orthologous Genes]] is the homoly is the result of a speciation event and occurs;. Are used for inferring phylogeny because they reflect the history of speciation events
[[Cytochrome C]] genes serve the same function in human and dogs
[[Paralogous Genes]] can diverge within a species because they are present in more than one copy

## Genome Evolution

Lineages that divereged long ago often share many orthologous genes
HUmans and mice divereged about 65 million years ago, 99% of genes are orthologous 
Gene number does not increase through duplicaiton at the same rate as phenotpyic complexity

# Concept 26.5 Molecular clocks help track evolutionary time

[[Molecular Clocks]] is calibrated by graphing the number of genetic differences between a gene against dates of abranch points known from fossil recrod
Inferred rate change
Some genes evolve in irrgular burtst, ratehr than clocklike precision

## Potential problems with molecular clocks

Molecular clocks do no run as smoothly as would be expected mutations weere nuetral

## Applying MOelcular clock: dating the origin of HIV

Descended from viruses that infect chimpanzees

# Concepet 26.6 Our understanding of the tree of life continues to change based on new data

[[Systematics]] has informed our understanding of lifes diversity

## From two kingdoms to three domains

[[Kingdom Plantae|Plants]] and [[Animalia]]

# Hierarchical Classification

Species that appear to be closesly related are grouped into the same genus
[[Linnaean System]] places related genera in the same [[Families]], [[Orders]], [[Classes]], [[Phyla]], [[Kingdoms]], [[Domains]]

A group at any level is a [[Taxon]]
Taxa are not italicized

# Linking Classification and Phylogeny

[[Phylogenetic Trees]] evolutionary branching diagram

# What we can and cannot learn from phylogenetic trees

[[Phylogenetic Trees]] are [[Hypothesis]]
[[Branch Points]] represent the common ancestor of two lineages
[[Evolutionary Lineages]] is a sequence of ancestral organisms leading to a descedant taxon
Chimps and humans are [[Sister Taxa]], two groups of organisms that share an immediate common ancestor that is not shared by any other group
[[Rooted]] branch point within the tree represents the most recent common ancestor of all taxa of the tree
A lineage that diverges from all other members of its group early in the histroy of the group is called a [[Basal Taxon]]
