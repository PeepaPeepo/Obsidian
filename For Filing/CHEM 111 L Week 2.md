# Experiment 1: Density

Get lab printout

Learn how to practice using glassware and other lab equipment
use proper significant digits
determine the densities of a liquid and solid 

# Equation

d or p = m/v
p = g/mL
p=g/cm^3

m=pv


***1mL=1cm^3***

Density

- The ratio of mass and volume

Example

- Density of gold is 19.3 g/cm^3
- What is the volume of a piece of gold with mass 3.4929

19.3g/cm^3 = 3.4929g/v
3.4929g/(19.3g/cm^3)

volume = 0.181 cm^3

Exercises

Soda

m = 35.303g
volume: 35.00ml

sigfig

1.009 g/ml

- Density is temperature is dependent
- Always document temperature when measuring
- There is a room thermometer

0.65643
0.65608
0.65690
/3

4 sigfigs

3 is infinite 
3 sources of infinite sigfig

Procedure

Part I

Density of Liquid

Determine identify of an unknown liquid

1. top-loading balance
2. analytical balance
3. graduated cylinder
4. volumetric pipet

A. graduated cylinder method

- mass of graduated cylinder
- Mass of cylinder+sample
- Volume of sample read the marks
- sample density is m/v

Volumetric Pipet Method

- Mass of Container like a beaker
- Mass of container + sample
- Volume of Pipet used
- Sample Density
- *Check with instructor which sig figs they want*

Density of a solid

- Regular Solids
	- use a ruler
	- volume = length x width x height
	- Mass
	- Dimension of object
	- volume 
	- density
	- up to one decimal place
- Direct method
- displacement method
	- graduated cylinder method (constant liquid volume
	- Measure a volume of a liquid
	- Called the Initial volume
	- Drop irregular object
	- measure the new final volume 
	- Volume of the object is the difference between the initial and final volume
	- 
Pycnometer Method

a constant volume device that can be used to determine a solid sample

- Ask identity of liquid
- Measure mass of pycnometer using analytical balance a
- Measure mass of pyconmeter +water b
- Measure the pass of pycnometer + solid c
- Measure the mass of your pycnometer + liquid andn sameple d
- Wipe excess before weighing

- Mass of Sample
- Volume of Pycnometer - volume of liquid mass of water/density 
- Volume of water surrounding sample


Experiment

- Use various methods

Tools used

- mass
	- top loading
		- looks like a standard balance
		- 2 decimal place
		- +/- (0.01g)
		- Good for quick
		- Often time sufficicient
	- analytical balance
		- 4 decimal places
		- +/- (0.0001g)
		- High precision work 
		- can open windows on sides
		- close all windows before measuring
		- Brush is used to clean the pan
	- Has tare feature
		- tare button, on/off, 0 button
	- Sigfig is based on balance
		- show everything that the balance shows
- Volume
	- liquid
		- Use a graduated cylinder
			- not as precise, variable
			- Read at eye level at lower minuscus 
				- 4 markins in between
				- 0.2
				- One decimal place
		- Volumetric Pipet
			- more precise
			- reproducible volume
			- 2 decimal places
			- 
	- Solids
		- Weighing boat and Weighing Paper
			- Both can be used
