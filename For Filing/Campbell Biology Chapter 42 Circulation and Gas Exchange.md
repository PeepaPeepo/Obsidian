Lungs or gills mediate gas exchange with the environment
Networks of highly branched, thin walled vessels
Heart is the pump

# Concept 42.2: Coordinated cycles of heart contraction drive double circulation in mammals

[[Mammals]] [[Cardiovascular System]] meets the bodies demands for O2
[[Right Ventricle]] pumps blood to the lungs via [[Pulmonary Artery]]
Blood flows through [[Capillary Beds]] in left and right [[Lungs]]
Oxygen rich blood flows into the left ventricle and is pumped out to body tissue via systemic circuit
Blood leaves the left ventricle via [[Aorta]] which conveys blood to arteries leading throughout the body
[[Capillaries]] rejoin forming venules, conveying blood to veins
[[Inferior Vena Cava]] drains blood from 

# The Mammalian Heart: A Closer Look

Human heart is about the size of a clenched fist and conssits of cardiac muscle
Two Atria have
[[Cardiac Cycle]]
THe contraction or pumping phase is called [[Systole]] 
Relaxation is the [[Diastole]]
[[Cardiac Output]] is the volume of blood pumped into the systemic circulation per minute
[[Heart Rate]] is the number of beats per minute
[[Stroke Volume]] is the amount of blood pumped in a single contraction
Recoil of blood against AV vavles adn teh Semilunar valves
Backflow of blood throguh a defective vlavel is a murmur

## Maintaining the Hearts Rhythmic Beat

Some cardiac muscle cells are autorhythmic meaning they contract wihtout any signal from the nervous system
[[Sinoatrial Node]]
Pacemaker is regulated by two protions of teh nervous system
Sympathetic division speeds up the pace maker
Parasympathetic division slows down the pace maker
