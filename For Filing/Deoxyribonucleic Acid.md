[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] molecules have two [[Polynucleotides]] that run in parallel and form a coil called a [[Double Helix]]. The [[Polynucleotides]]' [[Sugar-Phosphate Backbones]] run [[Antiparallel]] to each other like $\ce{ <=> }$ from [[5' Ends]] to [[3' Ends]] one polynucleotide and the other polynucleotide going [[3' Ends]] to [[5' Ends]]. 

One long DNA double helix include many genes. 

The [[Nucleobases]] on each of the [[Polynucleotides]] form base pairs on the inside of the helix.  

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] has different [[Tautomers]], or [[Isomers]]: [[A-Deoxyribonucleic Acids]], [[B-Deoxyribonucleic Acids]], and [[Z-Deoxyribonucleic Acids]]
