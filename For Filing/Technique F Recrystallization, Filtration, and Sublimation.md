# Procedure

## Exercise F.1: Recrystallizing an Impure Solid

Boiled 6 mL of $H_{2}O$ in a 10 mL erlenmeyer flask on a hot plate along with a boiling stick
Weighed and transferred 100 mg of ***Sample 170*** to an new 10 mL erlenmeyer flask
Transferred 1 ml increments of hot $H_{2}O$ to 10 mL erlenmeyer flask with 100mg of ***Sample 170*** while both containers are on hot plate to keep consistent temperature
Stopped until most of sample was dissolved
Transferred hot saturated solution with pasteur pipet to a filter pipet leading to a new small beaker while avoiding insoluble impurities
Transferred small beaker containing hot saturated solution to ice water bath
Filtered with Hirsch funnel apparatus and air dried crystals
Weighed and used measurement to calculated percent recovery
Put product aside for melting point measurement

## Exercise F.4: Purifying an Unknown Solid by Solvent-Pair Recrystallization

Heated 10 mL $H_{2}O$ in 25 mL erlenmeyer flask and 10 mL $EtOH$ in 25 mL erlenmeyer flask with boiling sticks until both reagents were boiling
Weighted and transferred 100 mg ***Sample 520*** into new 25 mL erlenmeyer flask
Transferred 1 mL increments of $EtOH$ to 100 mg sample until completely dissolved
Added drop increments of hot $H_{2}O$ to 100 mg sample solution until cloudy
Added drop increments of hot $EtOH$ until cloudiness resolves
Removed flask from hot plate to cool to room temp
Chilled solution in ice water bath
Cleaned and filtered with Hirsch apparatus
Measured product for percent recovery
Put product aside for melting point measurement

## Experiment 3.4 Properties of Solvents and Recrystallization of Organic Solids

Transferred equal amounts of Trans-tilbene to 5 test tubes
Transferred equal amounts of 9-fluoreneone to 5 test tubes
Transferred equal amounts of benzoic acid to 5 test tubes
Added hexane, toulene, acetone, ethanol, and water to each test tube of each sample
Observed solubility of each
Heated all test tubes in 50 ˚C water bath for further observation

# Discussion and Conclusion

Based on Table 1 the melting point range of the recrystallized ***Sample 170***, 123.3 - 125.1 ˚C, is similar to benzoic acid's melting point, 122 ˚C. Considering that Sample 170's range was narrow indicates a closer to pure substance, and a good reference point to use for comparison. The percent recovery is on the low end, during filtration plenty of crystals were seen forming after the saturated solution passed through the filtration apparatus. The cooling effect of the vacuum most likely triggered the solution to recrystallize in the collection chamber as opposed to before the Hirsch funnel. Sample 170 is determined to be benzoic acid.

Based on Table 2, Sample 520's melting range, 126.3 - 132.6 ˚C, was within range of trans-cinnamic acid's, 133 ˚C. Focusing on the melting range and percent recovery, 520's experimental result shows signs of impurity due to large melting range and a doubling of mass after crystallization. Causes of unfavored results most likely caused by user technique. Re experimentation is recommended to confirm results for Exercise F.4. Although data is less favorable, Sample 520 is determined to be trans-cinnamic acid.

Based on Table 3.2, ethanol is an ideal solvent for 9-fluorenone due to its partial solubility at cold temperatures, and solubility at 50 ˚C. When recrystallizing 0.1000 g of 9-fluorenone with ethanol crystals were not appearing at room temperature at a fast rate, it took more than ten minutes to observe minuscule amounts of crystals. The Hirsch funnel of the filtering apparatus seemed to be working at a slow rate, and many crystals were forming the collection chamber. This indicates that solution might have needed cooler temperatures to support the recrystallization process. Would repeat experiment with an ice bath for the hot solution, but ethanol technically was able to be used as a solvent for 9-fluorenone.
