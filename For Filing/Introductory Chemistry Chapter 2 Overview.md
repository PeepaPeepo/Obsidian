# Chapter 2: Measurements and Problem Solving
# Chapter Overview

Chapter 2 introduces the student to a cornerstone of the chemical sciences, the manipulation of numbers and their associated units. These concepts are very important for the rest of the course, and to be successful in this course, students must understand them well. Simple and complex unit conversions as well as problem-solving strategies will be covered and explained in detail.

# Lecture Outline

- 2.1 The Metric Mix-up: $125 Million Unit Error
- 2.2 Scientific Notation: Writing Large and Small Numbers
- Learning Objective: Express very large and very small numbers using [[Scientific Notation]].
	- A. Shorthand notation for numbers
	- B. Two main pieces: decimal and power-of-10 exponent
	- C. Measured value does not change, just how you report it

# 2.3 Scientific Figures: Writing Numbers to Reflect Precision

Learning Objective 1: Report measured quantities to the right number of digits.

Learning Objective 2: Determine which digits in a number are significant.

A. How many digits can I report? How many should I report?
	- Calculated values are rounded based on original given numbers or maximum sig figs scientific instruments can provide
B. Certain digits and estimated digits
	- The last number of rounded numbers are always uncertain
C. Counting significant figures
1. All nonzero digits are significant
	1. Any number that is not zero is significant
2. Interior zeros are significant
	1. Zeroes between non-zeroes and decimal points are significant
3. Trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant
	1. Decimal points are very important to recognize significant figures 
4. Trailing zeros before a decimal point are significant
5. Leading zeros are not significant
	1. 000.1 and 0001.0 are examples of leading zeroes that are not significant
6. Zeros at the end of a number, but to the left of a decimal point, are ambiguous
	1. Left of an implied decimal point that is not represented
		1. 100
		2. 12
D. Exact numbers

# 2.4 Significant Figures in Calculations

Learning Objective 1: Round numbers to the correct number of significant figures.

Learning Objective 2: Determine the correct number of significant figures in the results of multiplication and division calculations.

Learning Objective 3: Determine the correct number of significant figures in the results of addition and subtraction calculations.

Learning Objective 4: Determine the correct number of significant figures in the results of calculations involving both addition/subtraction and multiplication/division.

A. Multiplication and Division
1. Result carries as many significant digits as the factor with the fewest significant Digits
B. Rounding
1. If leftmost dropped digit is 4 or less, round down
2. If leftmost dropped digit is 5 or higher, round up
C. Addition and Subtraction
1. Result carries as many decimal places as the quantity with the fewest decimal places
D. Calculations Involving Both Multiplication/Division and Addition/Subtraction
1. Do steps in parentheses first
2. Determine the number of significant figures in intermediate answer
3. Do remaining steps

# 2.5 The Basic Units of Measurement

Learning Objective: Recognize and work with the SI base units of measurement, prefix multipliers, and derived units.

A. English, metric, SI
B. SI Units
1. Length − m
2. Mass − kg
3. Time − s
C. Prefix Multipliers
1. milli (m) 0.001
2. centi (c) 0.01
3. kilo (k) 1000
4. Mega (M) 1,000,000
D. Derived Units
1. Area − cm2
2. Volume – cm3
or L

# 2.6 Problem Solving and Unit Conversions

Learning Objective: Convert between units.
A. Units are important, most numbers have one
B. Include units in all calculations
C. Conversion factors change one unit to another, the value is unchanged
D. General problem-solving strategy
1. Sort
2. Strategize
3. Solve
4. Check

# 2.7 Solving Multistep Conversion Problems

Learning Objective: Convert between units.

A. Understand where you are going first
B. Not all calculations can be done in one step

# 2.8 Unit Conversion in Both the Numerator and Denominator

Learning Objective: Convert units in a quantity that has units in the numerator and the denominator.
# 2.9 Units Raised to a Power

Learning Objective: Convert units raised to a power.
- A. 1 inch = 2.54 cm, 
- so 1 inch3 = (2.54)
- 3cm3 = 16.4 cm3

# 2.10 Density

Learning Objective 1: Calculate the density of a substance.
Learning Objective 2: Use density as a conversion factor.
A. Mass per unit volume
B. Derived unit
C. Can be used as a conversion factor between mass and volume
2.11 Numerical Problem-Solving Strategies and the Solution Map
A. Come up with a plan before you use your calculator
B. Use the units to guide your plan
Chemical Principle Teaching Ideas
Uncertainty
Students generally have a hard time understanding this concept. One method is to refer to everyday
objects that they recognize. For example, you can talk about a coffee cup containing about 200 mL of
coffee. You then ask the students what the new volume would be if you were to add a drop of water
with a volume of 0.05 mL.
Units
Units are very important and should always be used. Consider giving the students a measured value
in many different units and having them guess what the unit is. Report the volume of your mug in
barrels. What is the volume of the room measured in teaspoons?
Density
Most students understand the concept of density or how much stuff is packed into a particular
volume. What they have a harder time recognizing is the fact that it is a conversion factor between
mass and volume. This is the easiest example that is discussed and should be emphasized as this
concept is used frequently throughout the course.
