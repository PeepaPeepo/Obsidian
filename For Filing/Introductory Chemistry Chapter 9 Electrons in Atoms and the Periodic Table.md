# Light: Electromagnetic Radiation

Light is a form of [[Electromagnetic Radiation]]
Travels through space at constant speed of $\ce{ 3.0 x 10^8 \frac{m}{s} }$
[[Wavelengths]] is the distance between adjacent wave crests, and represented with lambda [[Lambda]] $\ce{ \lambda }$. Wavelength is the distance between apex to apex
[[Amplitude]] is the 
White light is a combination of multiple wavelengths, such as the sun
[[Visible Light]] spectrum is red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet
Red light is the longest wavelength of visible light of $\ce{ 750 nm }$
Violet light is the shortest wavelength of $\ce{ 400 nm }$

[[Components of White Light]] is separated into constituent colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet

# Light: Color in Objects

Perceived vision is reflected light

# Electromagnetic Radiation (Photons-Particles of Light)

Light can be though of as a stream of particles
Particles of light are called [[Photons]]
A single packet of light energy
Amount of energy carried in packet depends on wavelength of light
Light waves have more energy which higher frequency and shorter wavelength
thus UV light

E = hv 
h = [[Planck's Constant]]
E = hC/lamda
$\ce{ E = \frac{hC}{\lambda} }$

# The Electromagnetic Spectrum

[[Electromagnetic Spectrum]] is the spectrum of [[Electromagnetic Radiation|Electromagnetic Energy]] arranged by least to greatest wavelength, it includes [[Radio Waves]] [[Microwaves]] [[Infrared Light]] [[Ultraviolet Light]] 

# The Elecetromagnetic Spectrum

Hot energy is actually infrared light
[[Microwaves]] have similar frequency of water
[[Radio Waves]] have long wavelengths

# Chemistry and Health Radiation Treatment for Cancer

X ray and gamma rays are called [[Ionizing Radiation]] because the high energy can ionize atoms and molecules

Ionizing radiation interacts with biological molecules 
Ionizing radiation damages the molcules that carry genetic information and teh cell stops dividing or dies
Implies that that ionization denatures dna of aggregating cell, but at the cost of the surrounding areas as well

# Each ELement has its own atomic emission spectrum of light

Neon atoms absorb electrical energy and reemit the energy as red light
Electrons that absrob energy get excited, and releases energy when it de excites

Emission Spectra of the ELements are Not Continuous

Some radiation is emitted at every wavelengths
Emission of an individual element includes only certain specific wavelenghts

# Light emitted by hydrogen contains distinct wavelnght that are specific to hydrogen

[[Emission Spectra]] 

# Niels Bohr Developed a Simple Model to Explain These Reults

[[Electron Shells]] n 1 - 5

[[Quantum-Mechanical Model]] replaced Bohr's
[[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]] represent probability maps of where electrons would most likely be
[[Electrons]] do not behave like flying particles
Unable to actually follow and see where electrons travels due to high speed of orbit around the [[Atomic Nucleus]]

[[Probability Maps]]

# Principal Quantum Numbers for Orbitals

[[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] orbitals may hold more than two electrons with opposing spins
Each arrow is an electron

# Energy ORdering of ORbitals for Multi Electron Atoms

Subshells within a principal shell do not have teh same energy because of electron electron interactions

[[Principal Shells]] are the main shells in [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]] which contain [[Subshells]] p, d, f depending on [[Quantum Numbers]]

Different subshells within the same principal shell have different energies
3d is higher than 4s

# Writing Ground-State Electron Configurations

[[Atomic Sizes]] are determined by the distance between outermost [[Electrons]], [[Valence Electrons]], and [[Atomic Nucleus]]. It is called the [[Atomic Radii]] 
Increase of [[Protons]] creates greater pull and decrease [[Atomic Sizes]]
[[Nuclear Effects]]
Moving down a [[Element Groups|Element Family]] increases the [[Atomic Sizes]] due to the addition of [[Principal Shells]], the distance between [[Valance Electrons]] and [[Atomic Nucleus]] increases

# 9.1 Blimps, Balloons, and Models of the Atom

Exploration of the [[Bohr Model]] and [[Quantum-Mechanical Model]] for explaining [[Periodic Law]], and how [[Electrons]] affect the [[Chemical Properties]] and [[Physical Properties]] of [[Elements]]

[[Alkali Metals]] also know as [[Alkali Metals|Group 1A]] tend to form 1+ ions
[[Halogens]] tend to form 1- ions

[[Niels Bohr]] helped the creation of the [[Quantum-Mechanical Model]] for the atom and is the foundation for modern chemistry.

# 9.2 Light: Electromagnetic Radiation

[[Light]] is a form of [[Electromagnetic Radiation]], a type of [[Energy]] that travels through space at the speed of $\ce{ 3.0*10^8 \frac{m}{s} }$

[[Light]] was described exclusively as waves of electromagnetic energy traveling though space

[[Waves]] are characterized by [[Wavelengths]], the distance between adjacent [[Wave Crests]]
[[Visible Light]] wavelengths determine color

Red light has the longest Wavelength of visible light 750 nm

Violet has the shortest 400nm

[[Components of White Light|ROY G BIV]]

[[Frequencies]] is the number of cycles or crests that pass through a point in one second

[[Wavelengths]] and [[Frequencies]] are inversely proportionate
The shorter the [[Wavelengths]], the higher the [[Frequencies]]
[[Ultraviolet Light]] has a higher frequency than Red Visible Light

[[Albert Einstein]] describes light as a stream of particles called [[Photons]], which is like a packet of light energy

Amount of energy depends on wavelength of the light, the shorter wavelenghts with high frequency has the most energy.

# 9.3 The Electromagnetic Spectrum

[[Electromagnetic Radiation]] ranges from [[Wavelengths]] of $10^{-16}m$ to $10^{6}m$
The range is called the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum]]
Short wavelength, high frequency on the right
Long wavelength and low frequency on the left

[[Gamma Rays]] are the highest frequency, shortest wavelength, and comes from the sun and starts, and some atomic nuclei, gamma rays can damage organic molecules

[[X-Rays]] are the next highest and can go through objects except Pb. These can case cancer as well

[[Ultraviolet Light]] can still damange organic molecules, can cause skin cancer and wrinkling of skin. 

[[Visible Light]] do not cause damage.

[[Infrared Light]] expels heat. 

[[Microwaves]] are usded in radar and ovens, it has the same natural frequency of water and can heat it up well.

[[Radio Waves]] are the longest form

# 9.4 The Bohr Model: Atoms with Orbits

When [[Atoms]] absorb [[Energy]] in the form of [[Heat]], [[Light]], or [[Electricity]] it reemits the energy as [[Light]]

[[Emission Spectra]] are not continuous with certain elements are unique to each.

They ar erelated to the motion of the electrons within atoms

[[Bohr Model]] states that electrons travel arounds the nucleus in circular orbits that are like planetary orbits. There are specific fixed distances from the nucleus.

The energy of each [[Bohr Orbitals]] is specified by [[Quantum Numbers]], which are fixed or quantized. 

The energy of each orbit increases per value of n, but get closer as n increases. 

When atoms absorb energy then can get excited into a higher orbit at the cost of stability. 
The electron falls back or relaxes to lower energy. and releases a photon containing the precise amount of energy called a [[Quanta]] of energy. It corresponds to the energy difference between the excited and relaxed orbits. 

The amount of energy in a photon is directly related to its wavelength

## Summary

[[Electrons]] exist at specific orbits called categorized as [[Quantum Numbers]]
When [[Energy]] is put into [[Atoms]], the [[Electrons]] get excited into higher orbits
When [[Electrons]] relax, the go back to a lower orbit and emit [[Light]]
The energy emitted between the relaxed and excited orbit are called [[Quanta]]. This is the epecific amount or energy when it relaxes.

# 9.5 The Quantum-Mechanical Model: Atoms with Orbitals

[[Quantum-Mechanical Model]] replaced [[Bohr Model]]
[[Bohr Orbitals]] is replaced with [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]] 
They use [[Probability Maps]] to show distribution of were electrons can be 
[[Electrons]] don't behave as particles in this model.

# 9.6 Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals and Electron Configurations

[[Quantum-Mechanical Model]] specifies numbers and letters

## Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals

Numbers in this model is called the [[Principal Quantum Numbers]] which identify [[Principal Shells]] of [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals|Electron Orbitals]]

Letters indicate [[Subshells]] which are s, p, d, and f.
Each letter is a different shape.

[[Ground States]] are the lowest energy states of atoms

$n=2$ [[Principal Shells]] contains two subshells, s and p. 
The number of subshells is equal to the value of $n$
Each subshell of the higher n value contains the subshell shapes of the previous n value.
p subshell contains 3 2p orbitals, x, y, and z
3d subshell contains 5 dorbitals
4f subshell contains 7 orbitals

## Electron Configurations: How Electrons Occupy Orbitals

[[Electron Configurations]] show the occupation of orbitals by electrons for particular atoms. 

$\ce{ H 1s^1 }$

H = element
1 = principal shell
s = subshell orbital
$^1$ = number of electrons in subshell orbital

[[Orbital Diagrams]] are alternative ways to represent configurations that use arrows representing electrons and its direction of orbit

Arrows represent the direction of [[Electron Spins]], and [[Pauli Exclusion Principle]] states that orbitals may hold no more than two electrons with opposing spins.

Principal shell energy values are not numerical sequential

[[Hund's Rule]] states that when filling orbitals of equal energy, electrons fill them singly first with parallel spins.

## Summary

[[Electrons]] occupy [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]] to minimize energy of atom
Lower energy orbitals are filled first in the following order

$\ce{ 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s }$

![[Figure 9.24 Orbital Filling Order.png]]

Orbitals cannot hold more than 2 electrons each
When electrons occupy the same orbital, the must have opposing spins
Orbitals fill singly first

[[Noble Gas Core Notations]] uses gases as a shortcut to say that the orbitals are full.

## Writing Electron Configurations

Find the [[Atomic Number]] of [[Elements]], which equals the number of [[Electrons]] in neutral [[Atoms]]
Then use the order of filling to fill out [[Orbital Diagrams]]

s shell is one orbital and contains 2 electrons 
p subshelle is 3 orbitals and contains 6
d subshell has 5 oribtals and contains 10
f subshell has 7 orbitals and contains 14

# 9.7 Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table

[[Valence Electrons]] are the electrons in [[Valence Shells]], which are also the outermost [[Principal Shells]], or the highest [[Principal Quantum Numbers]]

[[Electrons]] not in the [[Valence Shells]] are [[Core Electrons]]

[[Valence Electrons]] are the electrons distributed to the highest [[Principal Quantum Numbers]] N = X

The first 18 elements have a pattern

S block
P Block
d Block
F Block

Main group elements have the same number of valence electrons as its main group it belongs to

[[Transition Elements|Transition Metals]] have [[Electron Configurations]] that trends differently than main group elements.
The [[Principal Quantum Numbers]] in the d Orbital being filled is equal to its row minus 1

Cr and Cu is an exception

The transition seriies represent teh fillinw of core orbitals, and the nubmer of outershell electrons is mostly constant

The inner electron configuration for any element i shte the noble gas that comes before it. 
Determine outer electrons from block positions
The highest quantum number is equal to the row number the element is in
d electrons have the principal quantum number equaly to its row minus 1

# 9.8 The Explanatory Power of the Quantum-Mechanical Model

[[Chemical Properties]] of [[Elements]] are determined by the number of [[Valance Electrons]] they contain
Same element groups have similar chemical properties

[[Elements]] with [[Electron Configurations]] close to the [[Noble Gases]] arethe most reactive because they are closer to completing their valence.

[[Alkali Metals]] are very reactive because its one electron beyond a noble gas configuration

Na losing 3s electron because a 1+ ion with the configuration of Ne.

The predictable reactive elements are so because they are very close to noble gas configurations. Elements want to move towards stability.

# 9.9 Periodic Trends: Atomic Size, Ionization Energy, and Metallic Character

[[Atomic Sizes]] is determined by distances between [[Valence Electrons]] and its [[Atomic Nucleus]]
Greater [[Atomic Nucleus]] density means greater pull on electrons, condensing the size
Greater [[Principal Quantum Numbers]] means farther orbitals

[[Ionization Energy]] of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from the atom in the gaseous state.
