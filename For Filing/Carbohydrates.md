-  [[Carbohydrates]], also known as [[Carbohydrates|Saccharides]] or [[Sugars]], are [[Macromolecules]] that are composed of simple and complex sugars.
 - Its [[Polymers]] are called [[Polysaccharides]] and its built of [[Monosaccharides]]
 - It is used as [[Energy]] and building material for [[Organic Molecules]]
 - Two [[Monosaccharides]] can be joined by [[Glycosidic Linkages]] and form [[Disaccharides]] such as [[Maltose]], [[Sucrose]], and [[Lactose]]
 - When forming structural [[Polysaccharides]], the glycosidic linkages can form cyclical or linear [[Molecules]]
