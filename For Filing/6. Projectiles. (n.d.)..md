6. *Projectiles*. (n.d.). https://csueb.instructure.com/courses/45373/files/4665058/download?download_frd=1

1. Practice determining Experimental Uncertainties
1. Develop comparing experimental uncertainties, graphing with Excel, and Claim, Evidence & Reasoning
1. Gravity is the primary source that acts on the ball
2. Multiple heights will be used to observe range
2. Range is measured, in this experiment, from base of end of the ramp to resulting mark on carbon paper
2. For **Exercise. Random Uncertainty**, only test one height and answer the questions then show to instructor
4. Linear relation vs proportional to square root of height $\ce{ R= \frac{V_{o}^2\sin2\theta_{0}}{g} }$
4. Deciding how many times per height and range
5. Wider range of data helps with trendline analysis
5. Determine uncertainties of range and height
5. Using trendlines to determine each hypothesis
