[[Intermediate Products]] occur in [[Gas Evolution Reactions]] and are unstable compounds that [[Decomposition Reactions|Decomposes]] into [[Water]] and [[Gases]]. These include compounds such as $H_{2}CO_{3}$. If a compound has the constituents to make $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ and the other constituents are less [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] then mostly likely a [[Dehydration Synthesis]] will happen.
