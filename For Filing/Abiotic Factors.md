[[Abiotic Factors]] describes factors that are not living, this can include such as chemical and physical attributes. Some examples include [[Sunlight]], [[Temperature]], [[Wind]], [[Precipitation]], and [[Salinity]].

This is the opposite of [[Biotic Factors]] factors that include mostly living [[Organisms]] that are part of an [[Environments]].

Another addition is soil, oxygen that can limit distribution of species
Environment can affect survivability of species

[[Temperature]] can cause cell rupture when freezing, or heat can denature proteins at high temperatures. It can outwork homeostasis

[[Salinity]] affects water balance of [[Osmosis]], thus the specialization for fresh or salt water organisms

[[Sunlight]] limits distrubtion of photosynthetic species

[[Water]] and [[Oxygen]] species can desiccate with the lack of water, water affects oxygen availability

Rocks and Soil, pH and mineral composition can limit plants and the animals that feed on them
pH affects solubility of toxins and nutrients
Structure of substrates determine what attaches to it
