# Making Molecules: Mole-to-Mole Conversions

$\ce{ 3H_{2} + N_{2} -> 2NH_{3} }$

$\ce{ 3 H_{2} }$ react with $\ce{ 1 N_{2} }$ to form $\ce{ 2NH_{3} }$

# Stoichiometry in Action: Not Enough Oxygen When Burning Octane

The balanced equation shows that 2 moles of [[Octane]] require 25 [[Moles]] of [[Oxygen]] to burn completely:
$\ce{ 2C_{8}H_{18} (l) + 25 O_{2}(g) -> 16 CO_{2}(g) + 18 H_{2}O(g) }$
[[Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether]] $\ce{ CH_{3}OC(CH_{3})2 }$
Is a pollutant

# Making Molecules: Mass-to-Mass Conversion

[[Chemical Equations]] contains conversion factors between [[Moles]] of reactants and moles of [[Products]]
Interest in [[Mass]] of [[Reactants]] and [[Products]]
Convert all [[Mass]] to [[Moles]] to calculate everything.

$\ce{ 2 C_{8}H_{18} + 25 O_{2} -> 16 CO_{2} + 18 H_{2}O }$

$\ce{ 5.0*10^2 g }$ pure octane

$$\ce{ 5.0*10^2 * \frac{1mol}{114.232g}*16mol \frac{CO_{2}}{2 mol oct} * \frac{44gCO_{2}}{1molCO_{2}} }$$

# Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield, and Percent Yield

[[Limiting Reactants]], [[Theoretical Yields]], and [[Percent Yields]]
[[Theoretical Yields]] is the maximum yield produced with given [[Reactants]].
[[Actual Yields]] is the amount of [[Products]]
[[Percent Yields]] is [[Actual Yields]]/[[Theoretical Yields]]

[[Actual Yields]] depend on reaction conditions

# Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield, Actual Yield, and Percent Yield

[[Limiting Reactants]] is completely consumed during a chemical reaction.
[[Theoretical Yields]] is the amount of product based on limiting reactants.
[[Actual Yields]] are the actual amounts of products produced
[[Percent Yields]] is [[Actual Yields]] divided by [[Theoretical Yields]]

# Limiting Reactant and Percent Yield: Mole to Mole

The more costly reactant or most difficult to remove from the product mixture is chosen to be the limiting reactant.

# Enthalpy: A Measure of the Heat Evolved or Absorbed in a Reaction

Chemical reactions can be [[Exothermic Reactions]] or [[Endothermic Reactions]]. The amount of thermal energy emitted or absorbed by a chemical reactions is called [[Enthalpy]] or the change of [[Heat]]. 

$\ce{ \Delta H }$

[[Heat]] is the transfer of energy. 

[[Enthalpy of Reactions]], $\ce{ \Delta rxn }$, is the amount of thermal energy that flows when a reaction occurs at constant pressure

The sign of enthalpy of reactions depends on the direction themeral energy flows

Flowing out is - Delta H
Flowing in is + Delta H

$\ce{ \Delta H = E_{p} - E_{R} }$

$\ce{ CH_{4} (g) + 2 O_{2} (g) -> CO_{2} (g) + 2 H_{2}O (g) }$

$\ce{ \Delta H_{rxn} = -802.3kJ }$

# Stoichiometry of $\ce{ \Delta H_{rxn} }$

Depends on the amounts of reactants that actually react

$\ce{ C_{3}H_{8} (g) + 5 O_{2} (g) -> 3CO_{2} (g) + 4 H_{2}O }$

Make proportions after converting substance into mols

Mol of Reactant -> Enthalpy/Mol of Reactant

$\ce{ 11.8*10^3g C_{3}H_{8}}$ 

1 mol C3H3/44.11g/mol

Absolute value of $\ce{ Q }$ is requested and are the convey the sign of heat absorbed or given off in the reaction.

# 8.1 Climate Change: Too much Carbon Dioxide

[[Greenhouse Gasses]] negatively affect earth's atmospheric [[Temperature]] by preventing [[Heat]] to escape. Primary cause of CO2 production is [[Combustion Reactions]] of Fossil Fuels.

The numerical relationship between chemical quantities in a balanced [[Chemical Equations]] is called reaction [[Stoichiometry]]. Allows to predict the amounts of products that form based on [[Reactants]] or the other way around.

# 8.2 Making Pancakes: Relationships between Ingredients

Recognize the numerical relationship between chemical quantities in a balanced chemical equation. 

A Recipe gives a numerical relationship between ingredients and products

The original required reactant can be set over the original output

$\ce{ 1 cup flour + 2 egg + \frac{1}{2} tsp -> 5 pancakes }$

$\ce{ \frac{1cup}{5 pancakes} }$

# 8.3 Making Molecules: Mole to Mole Conversions

[[Balanced Equations]] are like a recipe for how reactants form products

$$\ce{ 3H_{2}(g) + N_{2}(g) -> 2NH_{3}(g) }$$
can be written as a proportion or ratio

$$\ce{ 3 mol H_{2} : 1 mol N_{2} : 2 mol NH_{3} }$$
If there was 3 mol n2 find mol nH

$\ce{ \frac{1}{3molN_{2}} * \frac{1molN_{2}}{2molNH_{3}} = \frac{1}{6molNH_{3}}}$

# 8.4 Making Molecules: Mass to Mass Conversions 

[[Chemical Formulas]] contain conversion factors between moles of a compound and moles of its constituent elements

When calculating mass, convert to moles first to flesh out the solution

Calculate mass of $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ after combustion of $\ce{ 5.0*10^2g octane }$

$\ce{ 2C_{8}18 + 25O_{2} -> 16 CO_{2} + 18 H_{2}O }$

# 8.2 More Pancakes: Limiting Reactant, Theoretical Yield, and Percent Yield

Calculate [[Limiting Reactants]], [[Theoretical Yields]]. and [[Percent Yields]] in balanced chemical equation

Balanced equation for pancake is 

1 cup flour + 2 eggs + 1/2 tsp baking powder -> 5 pancakes

What if there were 3 cups of flour, 10 eggs, and 4 tsp baking powder

to calculate the limiting factor of the given ingredients, check how much can be made with each reactant, and determine which gives the least amout of product.

3 cup flour * 5pancake/1cupflour = 15

Flour is the [[Limiting Reactants]] of the equation
The 15 pancake is the [[Theoretical Yields]] based on [[Limiting Reactants]]
[[Percent Yields]] are the final amount of [[Products]] divided by [[Theoretical Yields]]
