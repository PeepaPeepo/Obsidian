main features that plants developed to adapt to life on land.

450mya evolved from [[Green Algae]]
[[Charophytes]] is the green algae ancestor
Both are [[Multicellular Organisms]] and have same type of [[Chlorophyll]]
Stores [[Energy]] as [[Starch]]
[[Cellulose]] in the [[Cell Walls]]
Have [[Sperms]] and [[Eggs]] to make [[Zygotes]]

Primitive Plants such as [[Mosses]]
Small and [[Nonvascular]]

[[Vascular Systems]]
Seedless
Seed Producing
	Cone Producing
	Flower and Fruit Producing

# Land Adaptations

Retaining moisture from [[Transpiration]]
Early plants grew near waters' edge
[[Stomata]] are pores that allow gas exchange
Exchanges CO2 and O2
When closed H2O is less likely to evaporate
[[Cuticles]] are waxy coating that seals water in
Challenge of transporting resources
[[Vascular Systems]] are composed of tissue that transports [[Nutrients]]
[[Xylem]] transports water to the tops of of plants
[[Phloem]] transports sugars down from leaves to distribute nutrients
Allows plants to grow taller
Redwood trees are vascular

Large plants need to support it's own weight
[[Lignin]] is a molecule that hardens cell wall, gives wood strength

Problems include wind, dehydration, UV exposure, support, and reproduction

[[Pollen]] is carried by wind and animals like bumble bees
[[Seeds]] protects embryo in istself
[[Alternation of Generations]]
[[Sporophyte]] are [[Diploid]] and create [[Spores]] which are [[Haploid]]
Become male or female [[Gametophytes]]

# Plant Ecology

[[Mutualistic Relationships]]
Bacteria produce Ammonia for plants
Plants supply nutrients
Pollinators and Plants
Supplies Food from plant
Pollinator spreads pollen

Defense Adaptations

Spines, thorns, and chemicals to fight

Poison Ivy
