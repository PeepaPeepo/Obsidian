[[John Dalton|John Dalton's]] [[Dalton's Atomic Theory|Atomic Theory]] states the following about [[Atoms]]:

- All matter is composed of indestructible and indivisible atoms
- Atoms of [[Elements]] are identical in size, mass, and characteristics
- Atoms of different elements can combined into whole number ratio [[Compounds]]
- [[Chemical Reactions]] are the breaking and making of [[Chemical Bonds]] of [[Atoms]]

[[John Dalton]]'s model is different to the more 'accurate' representation that [[Rutherford's Atomic Models]] makes.
