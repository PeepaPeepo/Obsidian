# Midterm II Study Guide

This is not a comprehensive guide. Everything we talked about in class is fair game. Approximately 90% of the exam will be on the new material below with some of the material from the first third of the course being part of the test. If you have a good understanding of the concepts from the beginning of the course then this exam will be straightforward. The problem occurs if you have to go back and restudy everything.  The exam will be in the format as all of the other exams. Bring a Scantron. I wish everyone the best of luck.
