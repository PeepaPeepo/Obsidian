# The Scientific Method: Experiments

Scientific [[Hypothesis|Hypotheses]], [[Scientific Law]], and [[Scientific Theory|Theories]] ares validated by [[Experiment|Experiments]]

- If any of the of the following are inconsistent with the experiments, they need to be revised and re-experimented
- Weak theories get eliminated over time when experiments are conducted, consistent ones remain

# Example of Scientific Method

[[Dalton's Atomic Theory]] of [[John Dalton]] (1766-1844)

- Matter is composed of indestructible particles called [[Atoms]]
- Theory was a model of the physical laws and observations

# Scientific Theories

- Established theories are supported by experiments
- Well tested theories are close to truth in science

# Atomic Theory

- Two hundred years of experimental support

# A beginning Chemist: How to Succeed

# Chemistry Requires Calculation

- [[Quantification]] involves measurements as observation
- Allows to see difference

# Chemistry Requires Commitment
