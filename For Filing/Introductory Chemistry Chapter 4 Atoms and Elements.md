## How many atoms are in a pebble?

- Atoms are very small
- Pebbles are almost unconceivable
- One pebble contains more atoms than the number of pebbles in the SF bay

## Atoms and Elements

- About 91 [[Natural Elements]] 
- Smallest unit of an element is one [[Atoms]]
- There about 20 [[Synthetic Elements]]
- Some synthetic elements might be considered as Natural elements

## Atomic Theory of Democritus: What Cannot Be Divided

- [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] thought of the ideas of atoms
- Indestructible elements
- Democritus called them Atomos or [[Atoms]]
- First person to postulated the idea

## Atomic Theory of Dalton

- [[John Dalton]]
- Theory in three parts
	- Tiny indestructible parts called atoms
	- atoms of a given element have the same mass
	- atoms combine in simple whole number ratios to make [[Compounds|Compounds]]

## Modern Evidence for the Atomic Theory

- [[IBM]] has [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] STM to move xenon atoms
- Atoms are typically spherical 

## Thomson's Discovery of Electrons Shows Atoms Have parts

- J.J. Thomson discovered [[Electrons]]
- Electrons are negatively charged
- They are much smaller compared to the [[Neutrons|Neutron]] and [[Protons|Proton]]
- It barely affects the majority of the mass
- He proposed that electrons are balanced by some positive charge in the atom
- Electrons occupy [[Electron Shells|Electron Shells]]

## Rutherford's Experiments Requires a New Model

- [[Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment]]
- $\alpha$ particles were shot at cold foil
- Radioactive isotopes release neutrons
- Alpha particle is helium
- Some particles were directed in different directions

## Rutherford Proposes a Nuclear Theory of the Atom

- If [[Plum Pudding Model of the Atom]] was accurate, the rays would pass straight through

## Statement by Rutherford of the Nuclear Theory of the Atom

- Most of mass is in [[Atomic Nucleus]]
- Most volume is the empty space the [[Electrons]] occupy
- The number of number of electrons equal the number of [[Protons]] to create a neutral charged atom

## Distribution of Mass in the Atom is Not Uniform

- [[Atomic Nucleus]] is very dense but takes up small volume
- Electrons are less dense and but occupy larger space

## Relative Size of the Proton and the Electron

- Proton is almost 2000 times larger than an electron

## Electrical Charge is a Property of Protons and Electrons

- Electrical charge is fundamental property of protons and electrons
- Opposing charge attracts

## The Properties of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

- Protons and Neutrons have similar mass
- Electrons have much less mass relative to Nucleic sub-particles
- Number of Neutrons determine an element's [[Isotopes|Isotope]]
	- $^{21}Ne$
	- $^{22}Ne$
	- $^{23}Ne$

## Electrical Storm Provides Evidence of Charge in Matter 

- Electrical storm the charge balance of matter is disturbed 
- Quick rebalance results in electrical discharge

# How Atoms of the Element Differ from One Another

- Elements are defined the number of [[Protons]] it contains
- They can have different Electron orbital occupancy
- The number of protons an element has is its Elemental Number and the given number is Z

## Table of Elements by Atomic Number

- From left to right, the atomic number increases
- The Atomic number is the number of protons
- Neutrons = Atomic Mass or Weight - Atomic Number
- Atomic Weight is the average of an element's isotopes
- Electrons are equal to the number of Protons to satisfy the neutral charge requirement 

## Origin of the Names and Symbols of the Elements

- Most based on English name
- Some are based on Latin
- Potassium is K for Kalium
- Na for Natrium
- Latin Based Symbols
	- Lead
	- mercury
	- iron
	- silver
	- tin
	- copper

## Looking for Patterns: Dmitri Mendeleev

- When organized in atomic number, some properties recur periodically
- Na and K have similar physical properties

## Periodic Law Summarizes Many Observations

- Mendeleev's periodic law was based on observation

## Locating Metals, Nonmetals, Metalloids on the Periodic Table

- [[Metals]], [[Nonmetals]], [[Metalloid]]

## Typical Metal Properties

- Lustrous
- ***Tend to lose electrons during reactions***
- Iron, magnesium, chromium, and sodium 

## Nonmetals

## Properties of Metalloids

- Semi-conductive
- Have mixed properties
- fall adjacent to the step down division from B to AT
- Commonly used in Computers and other electrical devices

## Main Group Elements

- Properties are predictable based on location in [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]
- [[Elements|Elements]] are in columns, also known as [[Element Groups|Element Groups]], labelled with numbers and the Letter A
- [[Alkali Metals]], Group 1A
	- Highly reactive metals
	- High thermal and electrical conductivity
- [[Alkaline Earth Metals]], Group 2A
	- Reactive metals
	- Still thermal and electrically conductive
- [[Halogens]], Group 7A
	- Highly Reactive [[Nonmetals]]
	- Do halogens have a valence of 1?
		- Yes
- [[Noble Gases]], Group 8A

## Transition Elements

- Also known as [[Transition Elements|Transition Metals]]
- Have unpredictable properties based on its position in the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]

## Atoms Lose or Gain Electrons to Form Ions

- [[Atoms]] that lose or gain [[Electrons]] become an Ion
- Atoms with electrons more than [[Protons|Proton]] become [[Anions|Anion]]
- When the electron is less than than the amount of protons, it becomes a [[Cations]]

## Making Ions by losing Electrons

- $\ce{ Li^+ }$ 

## Making Ions by Gaining Electrons

- [[Halogens|Halogen]] [[Elements|elements]], Group 7A, tend to gain 1 Electron
- $\ce{ F^- }$

## Forming Ions of Main Group Elements

- [[Main Group Elements]] [[Valence]] is specified by the [[Element Groups]] number they are located in
- Sodium has a valance of one
- They tend to lose that electron to create Cation?  
	- Alkali, Alkaline Earth Metals, and Group 3A have tendency to lose electrons and create Cations
- Predict the charges of elements based on location relative to [[Noble Gases]]
- Main group elements tend to form ions that have the same number of valence electrons as the nearest gas
	- $Na$ after losing an electron has the same configuration of $\ce{ Ne }$
	- $\ce{ Ca^{2+} }$ has similar configuration as $\ce{ Ar }$
- Most Main group elements have predictable charges
	- 1A - 1+
	- 2A - 2+
	- 3A - 3+
	- 5A - 3- 
	- 6A - 2-
	- 7A - 1-

## Isotopes: When the Number of Neutrons Varies

- Atoms are identified by the number of protons
- Variation of [[Neutrons]] form different [[Isotopes]] of an element
- There are a natural abundance of different isotopes 
- Unstable isotopes are [[Radioactive Isotope|Radioactive Isotopes]]
- [[Mass Numbers]] are superscripted on the left of an element
- Number of protons or [[Atomic Number]] is subscripted on the left
	- $\ce{ {}^26_{13}Al }$
	- Would be read as Aluminum 26
- The mass number determines name of isotope like the following:
- 3 Carbon Isotope
	- Carbon 12
	- Carbon 13
	- Carbon 14
- The average mass of all isotopes determine [[Atomic Masses]]

## Isotope Symbol Notation

$$\ce{ ^A_{Z}X }$$
- A = Mass number
- Z = Number of Protons
- X = Element

## Mass Number is Atomic Number Plus Number of Neutrons

$$A = Z+N$$

## Isotopes: Isotope Symbols

$$\ce{ X-A }$$
$$Ne - 20$$

## Atomic Mass: The Average Mass of an Element's Atoms

- Atomic mass is the average mass of all existing naturally occurring isotopes 
- The Atomic Weight is in [[Atomic Mass Units|Atomic Mass Units]]
- [[Mass Numbers]] is different from Atomic Weight

$$Atomic\ Mass = P_{1}M_{1}+P_{2}M_{2}$$

- Percentages should be in decimal form
- Find Galliums Atomic Weight

$$\ce{ (68.9256*0.6011) + (70.9247*0.3989)}=69.7230$$

- Can you find the percentage if one is missing? Yes, total percentage equals a total of 100%
	- Subtract given percentage from 1

## Some Isotopes are Radioactive

- Nuclei of some Isotopes are radioactive
- Atoms emit a few energetic subatomic particles from their nuclei and change into different isotopes of different elements
- Emitted subatomic particles are called nuclear radiation

## Isotopes in the Environment

- Nuclear radiation is harmful to biological molecules
- $\ce{ Pb-185 }$ is radioactive for a short time
- $\ce{ Pu-239 }$ is radioactive for a very long time, thousand-billions+ years

## Beneficial Uses of Radioactive Isotopes

- $\ce{ Tc-99 }$ are used as diagnostic tracers

	- Tendency to lose and gain electrons give elements a predictable consistent charge
	- Elements tend to balance to their closest valence shell to fulfill and octet rule

### Periodic Table of Elements
