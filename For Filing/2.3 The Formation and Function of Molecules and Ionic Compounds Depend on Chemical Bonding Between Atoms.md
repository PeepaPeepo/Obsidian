- Atoms with an incomplete [[Valence Shells]] can interact with other atoms that complete it
	- Either the partner atom can share or transfer electrons
- Atoms end up staying close together held by attraction called [[Chemical Bonds]]
- Strongest bonds are [[Covalent Bonds]] in molecules and [[Ionic Bonds]] in dry ionic compounds
	- Ionic bonds in aqueous, or water based, solutions are weak

# Covalent Bonds

- [[Covalent Bonds]] shares a pair of [[Valence Electrons]] by two atoms, known as a [[Single Covalent Bonds]]
- Hydrogen has 1 valance electron in 1s
- when 2 hydrogens are next to each other and overlap
- They can share electrons
- 2 or more atoms held by covalent bonds form a [[Molecules]]
- $H$ Valence Electron is attracted to other $H$ Atomic Nucleus
- Then overlapped their Valence Electrons fill the first shell forming a Covalent Bond
- Oxygen has 6 electrons in 2s and need 2 more to complete its valence shell
- Two oxgens form a molecule by sharing two pairs of valence electrons
- atoms create a [[Double Covalent Bonds]] $O=O$ 
	- Two lone valence electrons can be paired with another pair of lone valence electrons
	- Such that $\ce{ C = C }$
- Each atom that can share valence electrons has a bonding capacity corresponding to the number of covalent bonds it can form
- The bonding capacity of Oxygen is 2
- The bonding capacity is called [[Atoms|Atom]]'s [[Valence]]
	- Usually equals the number to complete an atom's [[Valence Shells]]
- H = Valence is 1
- O = Valance is 2
- N = Valance is 3
- C = Valence is 4
- Phosphorus is complicated because it can make different single or double bonds
- Molecules like $H_2$ and $O_2$ are pure elements
- Compounds are combination of different elements
- [[Electronegativity]] attraction of a particular atom for the electrons of a covalent bond 
- The stronger electronegativity an atom has, the more strongly it pulls
- Covalent bonds between two of the same element has a neutral electronegativity
	- These are called a [[Nonpolar Covalent Bond]]
	- H_2 and O_2 does this
- When Covalent bonds are made into a compound, then each different atom creates a [[Polar Covalent Bonds]]
- Oxygen is the one of the most electronegative elements
- Oxygen in a water molecule has a partial negative charge and repped with d-, or “delta minus”
- Hydrogen has positive charges labeled as delta +

## Representing $H_2$ Molecules

- [[Molecular Formulas]]
	- $H_2$ 
	- the 2 represents the number of $H$ atoms
- [[Lewis Structures]]
	- $H:H$
	- Dots represents valence electrons 
- [[Structural Formulas]]
	- $H-H$
	- - = [[Single Covalent Bonds]] a pair of shared electrons
- [[Space-Filling Models]] is the closest representation

## Ionic Bonds

- Two atoms are so unequal in the attraction for valence electrons 
- Strips an electron away from partner
- It creates two oppositely charged atoms or molecules called [[Ions]]
	- Positively charged ion is a [[Cations]]
	- Negative Ion is an [[Anions]]
	- t in cation can be seen as a plus sign
	- Anion 'N's can be seen as negative
- The cations and anions attracted each other forming an [[Ionic Bonds]]
- The transfer of electrons is not the formation
- It allows the ionization of atoms that create the attraction
- Ions do not have to acquire charge from electron transfer
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 2.01.27 PM 1.png]]
- Na to Cl
	- Na Single Valence Electron Joins Cl's Vacant Space in Valence Shell
	- $Na$ turns into $Na+$ because there's more proton than electron
	- $Cl$ transforms into $Cl^-$ because there are more electrons than protons
- When the 2 atoms meet
	- The lone Na valence tranfers to Cl
	- The new valence shell of Na is S_2
	- Sodium with 11 Protons but now 10 electrons the + difference of protons turns Na in to a Cation
- Compounds formed by ionic bonds are called [[Ionic Compounds]] or [[Ionic Compounds|Salts]]
- Salts are often found in nature as crystals
- Salt crystals have vast numbers of cations
- Ionic compounds do not consist of molecules
- NaCl only indicates a ratio of elements
- Not all salts have equal anions:cations ratios
- $MgCl_2$ Magnesium chloride has two chloride to 1 Magnesium
- Magnesium turns into 2+ Mg to form with Cl-
- [[Ions]] applies to entire molecules that are charged
- NH_4Clantion is a single Cl-
- Nitrogen atom covalently bonded to four H, the whole ammonium ion has 1+
- Environtments affects teh strength of ionic bonds
- Dry salts are strgong
- But dissolved in water
	- ion is partially shielded by water
- A transfer of electrons create an Ion be it a Cation or an Anion

# Weak Chemical Interactions

- The strongest bonds are [[Covalent Bonds]]
- Weaker interactions within and between molecules are beneficial
- Many large biological molecules are held together by weak interactions
- Two molecules in a cell can make contact and temporarily adhere
- Several types of weak chemical interactions are important
- Ionic bonds as it exists between ions dissociated in water
- [[Hydrogen Bonds]] and [[Van Der Waals]] are curial to life

# Hydrogen Bonds

- A [[Weak Chemical Interactions]]
- Hydrogen atom covalently bonds to a electronegative atom, the hydrogen atom has a partially postive charge that allows it with negative charged atoms
- Noncovalent attraction between H and other negative atoms are [[Hydrogen Bonds]]
- In living cells they are usually O or H
- ![[Figure 2.14 A hydrogen bond.png]]

# Van der Waals Interactions (39)

- Some molecules with[[Nonpolar Covalent Bond]] can have +/- charges
- Electrons are not always even
- They can accumulate into one molecule
- Can stick to each other due to constant change
- [[Van der Waals Interactions]] are weak
- Only happens when atoms and molecules are close to each other
- Other weak interactions may form not only in molecules but in parts of large molecules
	- Proteins
	- Nucleic Acid
- Cumulative effects of weak interactions reinforce 3d shape of molecule
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 2.44.55 PM.png]]
- Atoms with Valence in s and p orbitals (shells $S_2$ and $S_3$)
- Creates tear drop shapes from [[Atomic Nucleus]]
- Connect larger ends of the teardrops with lines create a tetrahedon
- $H_2O$
 two of the oribitals are shared with H
 Creates a V Shape
 - Methane CH4 has shape of completed tetrahedron
- Molecular shape is crucial
	- Determines how hiological molecules recognize and respond to another
- Bio molecules bind temporarily to each other forming weak interactions
- ONly if the shapes are complementary
- Opiates
	- Morphine
	- Heroin
	- Derived from opiate
	- Opuates relieve pain and mood by weakly binding to specific receptor moleules on the surface of brain cell
	- [[Endogenous]]
	- discovery of [[Endorphins]]
		- Endogenous morphines
	- Endorphins are signaling molecules
	- Made by pituitary gland
	- binds to receptors
	- opiates have shapes similar to endorphins
	- can bind to endorphin receptors
	- Molecular shape leads to structure and function

# CONCEPT CHECK 2.3

1. Why does the structure $H-C=C-H$ fail to make sense
chemically?

- Carbon's valence is not completed
- H1 has valence of 1

- C has valance of 4
- $C_2$ has no space for Hydrogen

Answer: carbon atom has only 3 covalent bonds instead of 4
Why does Carbon in the question only have 3 covalent bonds?

2. What holds the atoms together in a crystal of magnesium chloride ($MgCl_2$)?

- $Mg$ has 2 Valence electron
- $Cl$ has has 7 Valence electrons
- $Cl_2$ = Double bond
- $MgCl_2$ = 
- Ionic compound

Answer: Attraction between oppositely charged ions form ionic bonds
How do I find out the ionic formation? 

Ionic compounds are formed by [[Nonmetals]] and [[Metals]]

1. WHAT IF? If you were a pharmaceutical researcher, why would you want to learn the three-dimensional shapes of 2 naturally occurring signaling molecules?
Important to have the proper shape of molecule to fit and bind to respective receptor molecule
Enantiomers have different efficacy and emergent properties  

Identical molecules need similar shapes that endorphins can react to
