# Chapter 12: Liquids, Solids, and Intermolecular Forces

## 12.1 Spherical Water

[[Intramolecular Forces]] are the attractive forces between different [[Atoms]] and [[Molecules]]
[[Thermal Energy]] is the overall constant movement of [[Atoms]] and [[Molecules]] that make up [[Matter]]
The weaker the IMF compared to thermal energy, the more likely the [[Substances]] to be [[Gases]]

## 12.2 Properties of Liquids and Solids

[[Liquids]] conform to the shape of its container, free flowing, and cannot be compressed
[[Gases]] conform to the shape of its container, constantly bouncing around, and can be compressed
[[Solids]] form a definite shape, overall static, and cannot be compressed. It can be [[Amorphous]] or [[Crystalline]]

## 12.3 Intermolecular Forces in Action: Surface Tension and Viscosity

[[Intermolecular Forces]] determine the [[States of Matter]] of [[Substances]]

### Surface Tension

[[Surface Tension]] is the tendency of liquids to minimize their surface area
	This characteristic resists penetration

### Viscosity

[[Viscosity]] is the resistance of a liquid to flow
	It increases with stronger intermolecular forces
	Long molecules can cause molecular entanglement

## 12.4 Evaporation and Condensation

Surfaces of liquids tend to evaporate because of its unsaturated [[Intermolecular Forces]]
Some molecules have enough energy to break their bonds from the surface
[[Evaporation]] and [[Evaporation]] is the change from liquid to gaseous state
	Greater surface areas increases evaporation
	Greater temperatures increase evaporation because kinetic energy overcomes IMF
	Rate of vaporization increases with
		Increased surface area
		Increased Temperature
		Weaker IMF
Liquids that are [[Volatile]] evaporate easily
[[Nonvolatile]] liquids do not evaporate easily
[[Condensation]] is the change from a gaseous state to a liquid state
	Number of gaseous molecules increases along with rate of condensation
	[[Dynamic Equilibrium]] is when the forward and reverse reaction are equal
[[Vapor Pressure]] of a liquid is the partial pressure of its vapor in dynamic equilibrium with its liquid
Water's vapor pressure is 23.8 mm Hg
	Increases with rising temperature
	Decreasing strength of IMF

### Boiling

[[Boiling Point]] is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the pressure above it

### Energetics of Evaporation and Condensation

[[Evaporation]] is [[Endothermy|Endothermic]] because it needs to absorb energy to evaporate
[[Condensation]] is [[Exothermic Reactions|Exothermic]] because it releases its energy to condense back into a liquid

### Heat of Vaporization

[[Heat of Vaporization]] is the amount of heat required to convert 1 mole of liquid to its gaseous state
	Known as $\ce{ \Delta H_{vap} }$ 
Heat of vaporization of a liquid can be used to calculate the amount of heat energy to vaporize a certain amount of liquid

## 12.5 Melting, Freezing, and Sublimation

[[Melting Point]] is the point where a solid becomes a liquid

### Energetics of Melting and Freezing

Freezing is [[Exothermic Reactions]] because it releases energy

### Heat of Fusion

[[Heat of Fusion]] is the amount of Heat (kJ) to convert 1 mole of a solid to a liquid state
	$\ce{ \Delta H_{fus} }$

### Sublimation 

[[Sublimation]] occurs when a substance at solid state converts directly into [[Gases]] state

## 12.6 Types of Intermolecular Forces: Dispersion, Dipole-Dipole, Hydrogen Bonding, and Ion-Dipole

[[London Dispersion Forces]] occur in all molecules and atoms. The orbit of the electrons and the nucleus can form instantaneous dipoles that occur for fractions of a time
	All atoms and molecules have london dispersion forces
	Larger electron clouds result in greater dispersion forces
	Dispersion forces increase with increasing molar mass
	Molar masses that increase lead to higher boiling points

[[Dipole Moments|Dipole-Dipole Forces]] occur when the [[Molecular Geometry]] of a substance have a fixed dipoles that do not cancel out
	polar molecules have higer melting and boiling points
	[[Miscibility]] is teh ability to mix without separating into two phases

[[Hydrogen Bonds]] form when it involves H bonding to O, N, or F

[[Ion Dipole Forces]] occur in [[Ionic Bonds]]

## 12.7 Types of Crystalline Solids: Molecular, Ionic, and Atomic

[[Molecular Solids]] are solids with composite units of [[Molecules]]
[[Ionic Solids]] are solids with composite units of [[Formula Units]]
[[Atomic Solids]] are solids whose composite units are [[Atoms]]
	[[Covalent Atomic Solids]] atoms covalently bonded
	[[Nonbonding Atomic Solids]] weak dispersion forces such as noble gases
	[[Metallic Atomic Solids]] have variable melting points, held by metallic bonds that consists of positively charged ions in electrons

## 12.8 Water: A Remarkable Molecule

[[Water]] has a low [[Molar Masses|Molar Mass]], a liquid at room temperature

# Chapter 13: Solutions

## Chemical Principles 

### Solutions

[[Solutions]] are [[Homogenous]] [[Mixtures]] with two or more components. 
	[[Solvent]] is the majority component, [[Solute]] is the minority component
	Water is the solvent in [[Aqueous Solutions]]
### Solid-and-Liquid Solutions

[[Solubility]] is the amount of [[Solute]] dissolved in a certain amount of [[Solvent]]
Solids in liquids increase with increasing temperature

### Gas and Liquid Solutions

[[Solubility]] of gases decrease with increasing temperature, but increases with increasing pressure

### Solution Concentration

Solution concentration specifies how much solute is present in a given amount of solution
[[Mass Percent Compositions|Mass Percent]], [[Molarity]], [[Molality]]

[[Molarity]] $\ce{ =\frac{moles}{liters} }$
[[Molality]] $\ce{ =\frac{moles solute}{kG solvent} }$
[[Mass Percent Compositions|Mass Percent]] $\ce{ = \frac{mass solute}{mass solute + mass solvent}*100\% }$

### Solution Dilution

[[Dilution Formulas]] include $\ce{ M_{1}V_{1}=M_{2}V_{2} }$

### Freezing Point Depression and Boiling Point Elevation

nonvolatile solute will extend liquid temperature rang of solution relative to pure solvent
Freezing point of a solution is lower than pure solvent
Boiling point of solution is higher than boiling point of pure solvent

[[Freezing Point Depression]] is $\ce{ \Delta T_{f} = m*K_{f} }$
[[Elevation in Boiling Point]] is $\ce{ \Delta T_{b} = m*K_{b} }$

### Osmosis 

[[Osmosis]] is the flow of water from a low concentration to a higher concentration through a [[Semipermeable Membrane]]

### Acid Properties

[[Acids]] are sour in taste, dissolves many metals, and turns blue litmus paper Red

### Base Properties

[[Bases]] are bitter in taste, feels slippery when touched, and turns red litmus paper blue

### Molecular Definitions of Acids and Bases 

[[Arrhenius Acid and Bases]] state that [[Acids]] produce $\ce{ H+ }$ in solutions, and [[Bases]] produces $\ce{ OH- }$ in [[Solutions]]
