[[Michaelis Menten Kinetics]] is a model created by [[Leonor Michaelis]] and [[Maud Leonora Menten]] that accounts for [[Enzymes|Enzymatic]] dynamics. It explains how [[Enzymes]] [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] [[Chemical Reactions]] and how concentrations of [[Enzymes]] and [[Substrates]] act as variables.

P/V, 

V is the rate of catalysis of an enzyme
Low S has a linear proportion to S

[[Definition of Reaction Rates]]

$\ce{ k_{1} }$ Is the binding of the enyzme to the substrate forming the [[Enzyme Substrate Complex]] 
$\ce{ k_{2} }$ is the [[Catalytic Rates]] and the limiting step= 
$\ce{ k_{3} }$ The dissociation of the enzyme substrate
$\ce{ k_{4} }$ The reverse reaction of [[Catalysis]]
