[[Teleomerase]] are [[Enzymes]] that add [[Telomeres]] repeat sequences to incomplete [[Daughter Strands]] to complete a [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] sequence.

It is type of [[Ribonucleicprotein]] and its subunit is [[Small Nucleolar Ribonucleic Acids|snoRNAs]] called [[Telomere Ribonucleic Acid Component|TERC]] which provides $\ce{ CCAAUC }$ templates to guide $GGTTAAG$. The [[Proteins]] component is called [[Telomere Reverse Transcriptase|TERT]] and it provides catalytic action. It [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesizes]] [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] from [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]].
