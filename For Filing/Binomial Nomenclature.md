A [[Binomial]], or two-part, naming scheme for species created by [[Carolus Linnaeus]]. It consists of a [[Genus]] preceded with a [[Specific Epithet]]. The first letter of the genus is capitalized, and the specific epithet is all lowercase; both are italicized. When discovering a new species, the name can be anything so long it is latinized. 

*Canuto paolo*

Scientific latin names are used only.
