# Procedure

1. Add ==spin vane==, ==0.50 g of 9-anthraldehyde== **(Possible Pre-weighed Yellowish Stuff)**, ==0.95 g of benzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride== (**Pre weighed white stuff**), and ==7.5 mL of methylene chloride== to clean ==Erlenmyerflsk==. 
2. Stir vigorously (1 on hot plate)
3. Cautiously add ==1.25 mL of 50% NahOH== **drop-wise to avoid splatter**
4. Add Yellow Cap Stir for 30 minutes
5. Add ==5 mL of Methylene chloride== and ==5 mL of water==, Remove spin vane, then pour solution into a ==sepatory Funnel==
6. Shake and vent, then allow layers to separate
7. Remove the **lower organic layer(Dark brown stuff)** to a clean ==erlenmeyer flask==
8. Extract the aqueous layer with another ==5 mL portion of methylene chloride==
9. Combine organic layer lower layer **(clear bottom layer after previous step)** with ==Anhydrous sodium suflate (3 Big Spatulas Worth)== Then Cap with Yellow 
10. ==Pipette== dried organic solution into ==50 mL round bottom flask== and remove methylene chloride using the ==rotaory evaporator or air==
11. Recrystallize the crude yellow crystals by adding ==2-propanol== into 50 mL then transfer to a beaker (Can do multiple portions to get material out of round bottom flask.)
12. Heated on hot plate at around 3, then cool back down
13. When solution precipitates a little bit, then add to ice bath
14. Filter with ==hirsch funnel==, use 2-propanol to rinse 
15. Air dry, ==weigh==, calculate percent yield, and ==melting point== of product
16. Obtain ==ir spectra== of ==starting material and product==.
