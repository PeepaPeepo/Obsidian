![[Life History]]  
	Related to [[Logistic Population Growth Model]]
	[[K-Selection]] is selection for traits that are advantageous at high densities
		Operate in populations living a density near limit imposed by resource
		Competition amongst individuals are stronger
			Mature trees growing in old growth forest
	Selection for traits that maximize reproductive success in uncrowded densities are [[r-Selection]]
		maximizes r, the rate of increase
		Often occurs in disturbed habitats that are being recolonized
		This includes weeds
Density dependent and density independent factors
	[[Density Independent]] includes birth or death rates that do not change with population density
		Physical factors that kill similar proportions of local population
	[[Density Dependent]]  a death rate that increases with population density or a birth rate that falls during rising density
Mechanisms of Density-Dependent Regulation
	Large population sizes
	Competition for resources with increasing populations
		Wheat farms get fertilizers
	Territoriality
		Space becomes a resources
	Disease
		Crowded populations are impacted by diseases
	Intrinsic Factors
		Intrinsic physiological factors regulate with population size
		Aggressive interactions and harmonal changes 
	Toxic Waste
		Waste by organsims can be toxic and limit a certain level of population
[[Population Dynamics]] is the population fluctuation from year to year or place to place, it is influenced by many factors and affect other species
	Fluctuation in fish populations can affect populations of birds that prey on them
[[Metapopulations]] are linked local [[Populations]]
	Occupy discrete patches of suitable habitat of unsuitable habitat
	Patches vary in size, quality, and isolation
Human population growth
	Future Scenarios
		9.8 billion people on Earth by the year 2050
		Rate slowed in 1960s
	[[Demographic Transition]]
		The movement of high birth/death rate towards lower rates which tends to accompany industrialization and improved living condition
	[[Replacement Levels]] industrialized nations populations are equilibrium, reproductive rates near the replacement level of 2.1 children per female
		Some places are below replacement level because of policies or culture
[[Age Structure]] is the relative number of individuals of each age in the population
	Commonly graphed as pyramids
	Can predict populations growth trends but also illuminate social conditions
Global Carrying Capacity
	First known estimate was 13.4 billion people by 1679 by Anton van Leeuwenhoek
	Difficult to estimate
	Some use curves like the logistic equation
	Generalize from existing population density and multiply this number by habitable land
[[Ecological Footprint]] concept summarizes the aggregate land and water area required by each person, city, or nation to produce the resources it consumes to absorb all the waste it generates
	Land and water area required to produce resources needed
	[[Global Hectares]] is the ecologically productive land on the planet divided by size of human populations
		1 hectare = 2.47 acres
		1.7 gha per person
		Anyone that consumes more is using too much resrouces
		Typical american is 8, globally average is 2.7 per person
	Energy Use
		First world countries use 30 times more energy
		Fossil fuel is the source of 80% of most countreis

# Chapter 54 Community Ecology

[[Communities]] are groups of [[Populations]] within a specified area. Communities and the environment make up [[Ecosystems]] 
[[Interspecific Interactions]] affect survival and reproduction of individuals that engage in them. Three broad categories include [[Competition]], [[Exploitation]], and [[Positive Interactions]]
	[[Competition]] occurs when individuals of different species compete for a limited resource, reducing survival or reproduction of both individuals
	[[Exploitation]] members of one species benefit by feeding upon members of the other species. 
		[[Predation]]
			When an individual kills the other prey
		[[Parasitism]]
			Taking nourishment from host
		[[Herbivory]]
			Eats but not kills another organism, specifically plants or algae
	[[Positive Interactions]]
		Members of both party may benefit, or one benefits without harm to the other
		[[Mutualism]] members of species benefit from interaction
		[[Commensalism]] One benefits, and it eventually may change into a mutualism
[[Competitive Exclusion]] states that two species whose members compete for the same resource cannot coexist permanently in the same place.

[[Resource Partitioning]] is the differentiation of [[Ecological Niche]] that enable species to coexist in [[Communities]]
	[[Ecological Niche]] is a specific set of [[Abiotic Factors|Abiotic]] and [[Biotic Factors|Biotic]] resources that an [[Organisms]] use in its environment
		This can include temperature range it can tolerate, time of day its active, and size and kinds of insects it eats
		[[Fundamental Niche]] are niches that can be potentially used
		[[Realized Niche]] is the actual used niche

[[Character Displacement]] is the tendency for characteristics to diverge more in [[Sympatric Speciation|Sympatric]] [[Populations]] than [[Allopatric Speciation|Allopatric]] populations of two [[Species]].
	Example includes beak depths are similar within the species, but varies greatly within the sympatric populations.

[[Predation]], [[Exploitation]]
	[[Aposematic Coloration]] is a warning coloration that warn predators of its danger
	[[Cryptic Coloration]] is camouflage that makes prey difficult to see
	[[Batesian Mimicry]] occur when prey species are protected by resemblance to other [[Species]]
	[[Mullerian Mimicry]] two or more unpalatable species resemble each other

[[Parasitism]], [[Exploitation]]
	[[Endoparasites]]
	[[Ectoparasites]]
	Host and Parasite relationship

[[Species Diversity]] is the variety of different kinds of organisms that make up a community
	[[Species Richness]] is the number of species in the community
	[[Relative Abundance]] is the proportion of each species that represent all individual species in the community
[[Shannon Diversity Index]] is used to calculate indexes of diversity based on species richness and relative abundance.
	$\ce{ H = -(p_{A} \ln p_{A} + p_{B} \ln p_{B}\dots) }$
		A and B = species
		p = relative abundance of each species
		H = diversity

[[Trophic Structure]] is the feeding relationships between organisms 
	Transfer of chemical energy from its source in plants and other autotrophs through herbivores to carnivores to decomposers is known as the [[Food Chain]]
	The position in the chain is the [[Trophic Level]]
	Groups of [[Food Chain]] form a [[Food Web]] 
	[[Primary Producers]] can include [[Phytoplankton]]
[[Energetic Hypothesis]] suggests the length of a food chain is limited by the inefficiency of energy transfer along the chain. About 10% of energy is transferred stored in the organic matter of each trophic level is converted.

Species with a Large Impact

[[Foundation Species]] have strong effect on communities because of their large size or high abundance.
	Includes trees, kelp, etc. They provide habitat or food, and can they can be competitively dominant
	Superior in exploiting key resources such as space, water, nutrients, or light
[[Keystone Species]] are not usually abundant in communities, they exert strong control on community structure by ecological roles.
	Examples include sea starts that limit competitive dominant species such as the mussel
[[Ecosystem Engineers]] are species that create or dramatically alter their environment
	Includes beavers
	Can be negative or positive
	Trees can be considered engineers

[[Disturbances]] are events such as natural disasters or human activity that changes communities by removing organisms from it or altering resource availability 
	[[Nonequilibrium Model]] describes that most communities are constantly changing after disturbances
	[[Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis]] states that moderate levels of disturbances foster greater species diversity than high or low level of disturbance. 
		The min and max thresholds exceed tolerances
		High level exceed tolerances of species
		Low levels allow out competition
		Moderate levels open up habitats for occupation
 [[Ecological Succession]] occurs when disturbed areas may be colonized by a variety of species, which gradually replaced by other species
	 Lifeless areas undergo [[Primary Succession]]
		 Usually prokaryotes and protists, then lichens and mosses
		 This process takes hundreds or thousands of years 
	 [[Secondary Succession]] involves recolonization of an area after a major disturbance has removed most but not all organisms in a community
 Biogeography
	 Latitudinal Gradients
		 Diversity in the tropics versus other parts
		 Factors include Evolutionary History and [[Climate]]
		 more time for speciation in tropics
		 Sunlight and precipitation occur at high levels in tropics
		 [[Evapotranspiration]] is the evaporation of water from soil and plants
	Area Effects
		[[Species-Area Curve]] all other factors being equal, the larger the geographic area of a community, the more species it has 
			One explanation includes more land equals more possible habitats and microhabitats
		[[Island Equilibrium Model]] states that equilibrium will eventually be reached where the rate of species immigration equals the rate of extinction
			Number correlates with island size and distance from mainland
			This includes habitat islands on lands such as lakes, montain peaks, or fragements
			Immigration decreases as populations increase
[[Pathogens]] are disease causing [[Microorgansims]], [[Viruses]], [[Viroids]], or [[Structure Property Relationship]]
	Affects on coral reef communities
	Whiteband diseases kills corals to slough of in a band 
	Influence community structure
	Community Ecology and Zoonotic Diseases
		[[Zoonotic Pathogens]] are transferred to humans from other animals, either through direct contact with an infected animal or via intermediate species called a [[Vectors]]
			Vectors include parasites

# Chapter 55 Ecosystems and Restoration Ecology

[[Ecosystems]] are [[Communities]] and its interactions with its [[Abiotic Factors|Abiotic]] [[Environments]]

## Energy, Mass, and Trophic Levels

Trophic level that supports all is the [[Primary Producers]] that are composed of [[Autotrophs]]
	Common autotrophs are plants, algae, and photosynthetic prokaryotes
	[[Chemosynthetic Prokaryotes]] can be primary producers in some ecosystems
	Following levels depend directly or indirectly on byproducts of primary producers
	Herbivores are [[Primary Consumers]]
	Carnivores are [[Secondary Consumers]]
	Carnivores that eat other carnivores are [[Tertiary Consumers]]
	[[Decomposers]] eat [[Detritus]]

Eating meat is inefficient at tapping photosynthetic production

## Concept 55.4: Biological and geochemical processes cycle nutrients and water in ecosystems

Nutrient cycles are called [[Biogeochemical Cycles]]
	Carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen occur in atm
	P, K, Ca are broadly dissolved in aquatic systems

## Concept 55.5: Restoration Ecologist Return degraded ecosystems to a more natural state 

[[Restoration Ecology]] seeks to initiate or speed up recovery of degraded ecosystems
	[[Bioremediation]] is the use of organisms, mainly prokaryotes, fungi, or plants, to detoxify polluted ecosystems
		They can consume toxic molecules, or other undegradable substances 
	[[Biological Augmentation]] uses organisms to add essential materials to degraded ecosystems
		Nitrogen fixing plants
		Mycorrhizal fungi can help plants access nutrients from soil
		Cannot guarantee recolonization of animals

# Chapter 56 Conservation Biology and Global Change

[[Conservation Biology]] integration of ecology, physiology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and genetics in effort to conserve biological diversity 

Current rate of extinction is 100 - 1000 times the background or typical extinction rate.

## Three levels of Biodiversity

[[Genetic Diversity]]
	Genetic variation within a population and between populations
[[Species Diversity]]
	Number of species in an ecosystem or across the biosphere
	1.8 million named species of organism
	actual number estimated to be 5 - 100 million
	[[Endangered Species]] are species on the brink of [[Extinction]]
	[[Threated Species]] are on the brink of becoming an [[Endangered Species]]
	IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is a resources that documents species endangerment
[[Ecosystem Diversity]]
	Variety of [[Ecosystems]] in the [[Biosphere]]
	Human activity reduces [[Ecosystem Diversity]]
	Wetlands in the US are drained and converted
	Local extinction of a species can affect ecosystem depending on their roles
		The extinction of pollinators 

## Biodiversity and Human Welfare

Arguments for humans caring for biodiversity
	[[Biophilia]] is the human sense of connection to nature
	[[Morality]] other species are entitled to life
	[[Obligation]] preservation for future generations
	[[Benefits]] of species and genetic diversity
		Species related to crops can further enhance traits
		Drugs are from plants
		Loss of genes that can be useful proteins
[[Genetic Diversity]] can benefit humans for producing medicine, food, petroleum substitutes, and industrial chemicals
	Many species go extinct before discovering them

## Ecosystem Services

[[Ecosystem services]] encompass the processes by natural ecosystems help sustain human life
	Purification of air and water
	Detox an decomp of wastes
	Crop pollination, pest control, and soil preservation
	Moderation of weather extremes and flooding

## Threats to Biodiversity

Four major threats to biodiversity include [[Habitat Loss]], introduced species, overharvesting, and global change

[[Habitat Loss]] caused by human alteration through agriculture, forestry, urban development, minin, and pollution is the greatest threat
	[[Habitat Fragmentation]] caused by interruption of habitats with urbanization 
	Coral reef destroyed through pollution and fishing
[[Introduced Species]] are moved by humans to new regions, intentionally or accidentally
	No natural predators or can outcompete locals
[[Overharvesting]] harvests organisms at rates the ability to rebound
	Species with restricted habitats are at risk or vulnerable
	Large species are susceptible
Global change include alterations in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and broad ecological systems that reduce earths cap to support life

[[Acid Precipitation]] contains [[Sulfuric Acid]] and [[Nitric Acid]] that causes low pH
Air pollution can cause precipitation down wind

[[Nutrient Enrichment]] displaces nutrients
[[Critical Load]] is the amount of added nutrient that can be absorbed by plants without damaging ecosystems integrity, excess can be transferred into runoff affecting aquatic systems

Toxins in the environment
	Can stay for long periods of time
	[[Biological Magnification]] occurs when toxins are passed up the food chain and concetrated in organisms at higher tropic levels
	PCB, pesticides, DDT, and subject to it 
Pharmaceuticals can enter aquatic ecosystems and Estrogen can shift sex ratio within species of fish and reptiles

Plastic Waste, [[Microplastics]] are formed from break down of larger pieces by wave action and UV light, consumption of plastics kill animals

Plastic can be contaminated and disease aquatic animals such as coral
25% of fish contain microplastics in their guts 

[[Climate Change]] is a directional change that lasts for three decades or more 
[[Greenhouse Effect]] accumulation of green housegasses causes rapid warming
Depletion of Ozone CFC's are responsible for destroying atmospheric ozone
	It is a catylsts and reduces O3 to O2
	Ozone protext from excess UV

Inbreeding and genetic drift can draw a small population down an extinction vortex
	Loss of genetic variation needed to adapt
[[Minimum Viable Population Size]] is the minimum population size to sustain numbers
[[Effective Population Size]] based on [[Breeding Potential]] is a fraction of the actual population size
	It is needed to estimate [[Minimum Viable Population Size]]
Loss of critical habitat can cause threated populations to decline
	Resolve conflict between human need and habitat needs of species
[[Charismatic Species]] 
[[Edge Habitat]] has its own conditions than its sides
Fragmentaion favors species that thrive in edge habitats

[[Movement Corridor]] is a narrow strip oor series of small clumps of habitat connecting other isolated patches
	Promote dispersial and reduce inbreeding
