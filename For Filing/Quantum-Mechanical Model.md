The [[Quantum-Mechanical Model]] is a model that replaced the [[Bohr Model]] of [[Atoms]]. It utilizes probability of where [[Electrons]] can be when orbiting [[Atoms]]. The system utilizes [[Principal Shells]] and [[Subshells]]. 

[[Principal Shells]] are denoted by [[Principal Quantum Numbers]], and [[Subshells]] are notated by the letters s, p, d, and f.

[[Principal Shells]] 

$\ce{ n }$

[[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]] 
[[Subshells]] = s, p, d, and f
