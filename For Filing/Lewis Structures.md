- Lewis Dot Structure is a form of chemical notation depicting [[Valence Electrons]] and [[Covalent Bonds]] between elements of [[Molecules]] and [[Compounds]] with accurate bonding angles
- Dots represent unpaired [[Electrons]] of an Element or Molecule
- Lines can represent [[Covalent Bonds]] with single, double, or triple lines
	- [[Single Covalent Bonds]]
	- [[Double Covalent Bonds]]
	- [[Triple Covalent Bonds]]

# Examples

## Carbonyl Group with Variable R
$$\ce{ R-C=O }$$

## Oxygen with its Valence Electrons
$$\ce{ O: }$$

# How to Draw Lewis Diagrams

1. Determine the total number of [[Valence Electrons]] in the [[Molecules]]; it is the sum of the [[Main Group Elements|Group Number A]] of the all atoms and the charge.
2. Draw [[Skeletal Structures]] which connects all the [[Atoms]] using only [[Single Covalent Bonds]]. The [[Central Atoms]] are the ones that can form the greatest number of [[Chemical Bonds]] or expand its [[Octets]]; [[Atoms]] lower or to the right on the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]
3. Add [[Lone Pairs]] of [[Electrons]] with the remaining [[Valence Electrons]] to the [[Terminal Atoms]] until their [[Octets]] complete or run out of [[Electrons]]
4. Remaining electrons can be used to complete the octet of the central atom
	1. If ran out of electrons, use lone pairs from terminal atom
	2. Move a lone pair from a terminal between the central and itself to from another bond
5. Determine the [[Formal Charges]] for the atoms
	1. [[Element Groups|Group Number]] of atom - $\ce{ \frac{1}{2} }$ number of [[Bonding Electrons]] - Number of [[Lone PairsLone Pair]] Electrons
