Isoleucine, abbreviated as Ile or I, is an [[Amino Acids|amino acid]] where its [[Side Chains|side chain]] is made of four modified [[Methyl Group|methyl groups]] like [[Alanine]], [[Valine]], [[Leucine]], and [[Proline]]. The methyl group is arranged like a backwards L, with the main line of $-CH_{3}$ counts down to $-CH$. Connected to the left of $-CH$ is $H_{3}C$. 

Isoleucine is [[Nonpolar]] due to the difference of [[Electronegativity]] between the the Hydrogens and Carbons
