# 11 Chapter Review

## Concept 11.1 External Signals are converted to responses within the cell

[[Signal Transduction Pathways]] is like a sensor
[[Local Signaling]] involves direct contact or secrtion of local regulators
[[Long Distance Signaling]] use [[Hormones]] to pass signals electrically
[[Signal Reception]], [[Signal Transduction]], [[Cellular Response]]

### Concept 11.2 Signal Reception: A Signaling molecule binds to a receptor, cause it to change shape

[[Ligands]] are signaling molecules and bind to specific [[Receptors]], and the receptor change in shape is the initiation of transduction

Three major receptors 
[[G Protein-Coupled Receptors]]
Interact with G proteins, ligand bind activates receptor and activates another protein

[[Receptor Tyrosine Kinases]] RTKs reactive to binding of GPCRs
	Forms dimers and adds phosphate groups to tyrosine on another monomer to make a dimer
	Relay proteins get activated to phosphorylated tyrosines

[[Ligand-Gated Ion Channels]] open or close based on signals and reuglates ions

### Concept 11.3 Signal Transduction: Cascades of molecular interactions transmit signals from receptors to relay molecules in the cell

[[Phosphorylation Cascades]] - a series of [[Protein Kinases]] adds [[Phosphate Groups]] to next in line

[[Protein Phosphatases]] remove the groups and regulates activity

[[Second Messengers]] include [[cyclic AMP]] and $\ce{ Ca^2+ }$ diffuse through cytosol
[[G Proteins]] activate [[Adenylyl Cyclase]] which make [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]

[[Receptor Tyrosine Kinases]] use two other messengers [[Diacylglycerol]] and [[Inositol Triphosphate]] and can trigger $\ce{ Ca^2+ }$ levels

### Concept 11.5 Apoptosis requires integration of multiple cell-signaling pathways

[[Apoptosis]] is programmed cell death
