# Concept 16.1 DNA is the Genetic Material

## Evidence that DNA can Transform Bacteria

[[Transformation]] is the change in [[Genotypes]] and [[Phenotypes]] due to assimilation of external [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] by a cell

## Evidence that Viral DNA can Program Cells

Study of [[Bacteriophages]], bacteria eaters, are types of [[Viruses]]

[[Viruses]] can be [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and sometimes [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] covered by a coat which is simple a [[Proteins]]
Viruses highjack [[Cells]] function

[[Bacteriophages|Phages]] are used as tools, such as [[T2]] a phage that infects [[Escherichia Coli|E. Coli]] 
[[T2]] is [[Bacteriophages]] that infect [[Escherichia Coli|E. Coli]], and it can convert it into a T2 factory

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] injected by [[Bacteriophages|Phages]] must be the molecule carrying the genetic information that makes cells produce new viral [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and [[Proteins]]

## Additional Evidence That DNA is the Genetic Material

[[Chargaff's Rule]] state that [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] [[Base Pairs]] vary between species, [[Adenine]] and [[Thymine]] [[Base Pairs]] are roughly equal, as are those of [[Guanine]] and [[Cytosine]] bases

## Building a Structural Model of DNA

[[Watson Crick Base Pairing]] states that DNA pairs as AT GC or RNA as AU GC

# Concept 16.2 Many Proteins Work Together in DNA Replication and Repair

[[DNA Replication]] is the copying of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]

## The Basic Principle: Base Pairing to a Template Strand

[[Semi-Conservative Replications]], [[Conservative Replications]], and [[Dispersive Replications]]

## DNA Replication: A Closer Look

[[Escherichia Coli|E. Coli]] has a single [[Chromosomes]] with about 4.6 million [[Nucleotides]] pairs, and it can copy its DNA and divide in less than an hour

[[Somatic Cells]] in humans have about 46 [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] Molecules in its [[Cell Nucleus]], one long double helical molecule per [[Chromosomes]] which is about 6 billion [[Nucleotides]] pairs, which is over 1,000 times more than [[Bacteria|Bacterial]] cells

There are a few [[Enzymes]] and [[Proteins]] that function in [[DNA Replication]]
There is more info on [[Bacteria]] than [[Eukarya]]

## Getting Started

The replication of [[Chromosomes|Chromosomal]] [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] begins at [[Origins of Replication]], short stretches of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] that have a specific sequenec of [[Nucleotides]]. 

[[Escherichia Coli|E. Coli]] [[Chromosomes]] are circular and have a single origin.

[[Proteins]] that recognize [[Origins of Replication]] attached to the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and separating the two strands creating [[Replication Bubbles]]

Replication of DNA proceeds in both directions until the entire molecule is copied

[[Eukarya]] chromosomes may have hundreds or thousands of origins of replications, the multiple bubbles fuse and speed up copying of long DNA molecules. It happens bi-directionally.

At the end of each [[Replication Bubbles]] is a [[Replication Forks]] where [[Parent Strands]] are being unwound.

[[Helicase]] are [[Enzymes]] that untwist the [[Double Helix]] at the [[Replication Forks]], separating the [[Parent Strands|Parental Strands]] and converting them into [[Template Strands]]

[[Single Stranded Binding Proteins]] bind to unpaired strands and keep them from re-paring. The untwisting of the bubble causes tighter twisting and strain ahead of the [[Replication Forks]]

[[Topoisomerases]] is an enyzme that relieves the strain by breaking, swiveling, and rejoing DNA strands. There are multiple types of [[Topoisomerases]], TOPO I TOPO II and TOPO III

## Synthesizing a New DNA Strand 

Unwound sections of [[Parent Strands|Parental Strands]] are templates for [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of new complementary DNA strands

![[Figure 16.14 Some of the proteins involved in the initiation of DNA replication.png]]

[[Enzymes]] that [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesize]] [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] cannot initiate synthesis of [[Polynucleotides]], they can only add to ends of existing chain that is base-paired with the [[Template Strands]]

An initial chain of [[Nucleotides]] that can be used as pre-existing chain is produced during DNA synthesis, which is a short stretch of [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] called a [[Primers]] which is [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesized]] by [[Primase]]

[[Primase]] starts as complementary RNA chain with a single [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] [[Nucleotides]] and adds one at a time using [[Parent Strands|Parental Strands]] [[Template Strands]]

Completed [[Primers]] is about 5 - 10 [[Nucleotides]] long and is laid [[Antiparallel]] to the [[Parent Strands|Parental Strands]]

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase]] [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of new [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] by added nucleotides to the 3' end of an existing chain.

[[Escherichia Coli|E. Coli]] has several DNA polymerases
[[Eukaryotic Cells]] have atleast a11 different [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]]

most DNA Polymeerases rerquire the primer and template 

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]] catalyzes the addition of each monomer to the growing end of a [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] strand, gamma and beta phosphate break off creating a pyrophosphate

the hyrolysis of the pyrophosphate turn into two inorganic phosphates is a coupled exergonic reaction taht helps drive the polymerization reaction

## Antiparallel Elongation


[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]] can only add [[Nucleotides]] to the free 3' end of the primer or growing dna strand.

Strands can only elongate in the 5' -> 3' direction

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase III|DNA Pol III]] can only [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesize]] a complementary strand by elongaing the new dna from 5' to 3'

DNA POL III strays in the fork on the template strand and adds nucleotides from there, which is known as the [[Leading Strands]], only one primer is needed for DNA pol III to synthesize the entire leading strand

[[Lagging Strands]] is synthesized discontinuously as a series of segments, the segments are called [[Okazaki Fragments]] and are about 1000 - 2000 [[Nucleotides]] long

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerases I|DNA Pol I]] replaces RNA nucleotide of adjacent primer with DNA nucleotides, but cannot join the final nucleotid .

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Ligases|DNA Ligases]] joins the sugar phosphate back bones of all [[Okazaki Fragments]]

[[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]] of leading strand and lagging strands are concurrent and at the same speed

Each new fragment of lagging strand cannot be started until template has been exposed at the replication fork

# Proofreading and Repairing DNA

[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]] removes mismatched [[Nucleotides]] and resumes [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesis]].

Sometimes the mismatches sneak past the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase|DNA Polymerases]], so a [[Mismatch Repair]] is performed by different [[Enzymes]].
