- [[Atoms]]
- [[Dalton's Atomic Theory]]
- [[Democritus]]
	- ~400 BC
- [[John Dalton]]
	- 1800's
	- Atomic Theory
- [[Subatomic Particles]]
	- [[Electrons]]
	- [[Protons|Proton]]
	- [[Neutrons|Neutron]]
- [[Atomic Mass Units]]
- [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]
	- Organization is done by Russian Chemist Dmitri Mendeleev
	- German Chemist Julius Lothar Meyer has independently suggested a similar organization
	- Dmitri left some spaces because he speculated there are non-discovered elements based on his Periodic Law
	- [[Periodic Law]]
	- [[Metals]]
	- [[Nonmetals]]
	- [[Metalloids]]
	- [[Main Group Elements]]
		- Columns labelled with Number and letter A
	- [[Transition Elements]] or Transition Metals
		- Less predictable based on position in periodic table
		- Columns labelled with Number and letter B
	- [[Element Groups]]
		- Elements in the same column belong to the same Family or Group
		- Group 8A are the Noble Gases
	- [[Alkali Metals]]
		- Group 1A
		- Highly Reactive Metals
	- [[Alkaline Earth Metals]]
		- Group 2A
		- Reactive, but not as much as Alkali Metals
	- [[Halogens]]
		- Group 7A
		- Very Reactive Nonmetals
		- Chlorine is used for sterilizing and disinfecting due to reactivity
		- Kills bacteria and microscopic organisms
	- [[Noble Gases]]
		- Group 8A
		- Chemically Inert Gases
		- Chemically Stable
		- Complete Valence
		- Cannot/Won't combine with other elements
- [[Ions]]: Gaining and Losing Electrons
	- [[Cations]]
	- [[Ions]]
	- Periodic Trends
	- Alkali Metals +1
	- Alkaline Earth Metals +2
	- Halogens -1
- [[Isotopes]]
	- Isotopes have the same chemical properties but different masses
	- Some isotopes are more common
	- Chemical Symbol with Mass Number indicates which isotope
	- Some Elements have many or less isotopes
- [[Atomic Masses]]
	- Value on periodic table that represents average mass of all isotopes
- [[Dalton's Atomic Theory]]
- Discovery of Atoms Nucleus
	- [[Plum Pudding Model of the Atom]]
	- [[Space-Filling Models]]
- Charge
