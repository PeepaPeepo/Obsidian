[[Oxidation Numbers|Oxidation States]], or [[Oxidation Numbers]], assigns electrons within [[Molecules|Molecular]] [[Compounds]] as if it was [[Ionic Bonds]]. It is useful for [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]] and keeping track of electron transfers. It has a hierarchal set of rules for assignment.

1. Free elements are neutral
2. Monoatomic ions are equal to its charge
3. Sum of oxidation numbers are equal to 0 or its charge
4. In compounds groups 1 and 2 have their respective charges
5. Go through the rules from top to bottom
