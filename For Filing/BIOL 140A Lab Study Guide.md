What does spin column do
what does pcr do, it doesn't multiply
Gene is certain part of DNA- 


Understand the concepts related to DNA isolation, NanoDrop spectrophotometry, PCR, restriction enzyme digests, agarose gel electrophoresis, and micropipetting. Understand the rationale behind the bacterial transformation experiment and the antibiotics in plants experiment. Terminology includes, but is not limited to, plasmid, transformation, PCR, gene, genome, genotype, locus, agarose gel electrophoresis, primer, molecular weight marker, homozygous, heterozygous, chromosome, buffer, thermocycler, NanoDrop, incubator, DNA, RNA, and the central dogma of molecular biology.
