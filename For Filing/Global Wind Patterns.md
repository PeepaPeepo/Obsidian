[[Global Wind Patterns]] is initiated by the sunlight hitting the [[Equator]]. The intense sunlight casues global wind patterns and [[Precipitation]].

The [[Equator]], when receiving so much light, evaporates a lot of water and forms large wet air masses. The masses move towards the poles but cool down causing rainfall. The dry after product air collects moisture from regions around 30 degrees and some precipitates towards the poles.

Land near the equator moves fast than at the poles, deflecting winds from vertical paths.
