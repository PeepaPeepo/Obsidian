## Proust Statement of Law of Constant Composition

- Joseph Proust
- Elements combine in fixed proportions
- Law of Constant Composition
- All samples of a compound have the same proportions of their constituent elements

## Mass Ratio of Elements in Water is Constant

- Mass Ratio
$$\ce{ \frac{16.0 g O}{2.0 g H} }$$

## Mass Ratio of Elements in Ammonia is Constant

$$\ce{ \frac{14.0 g N}{3.0 g H} }$$
## Chemical Formulas: How to Represent Compounds

- [[Chemical Formulas]] indicates the elements present in a compound and the relative number of atoms in each
- $\ce{ H_{2}O }$
- Ratio is 2:1
- Subscript after an element indicates how many atoms are present in the compound
- The omission of the post subscript implies there is only one element
- $NaCl$
	- 1:1 to Ratio
- $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ Ratio of 1:2
- $\ce{ C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} }$ Sucrose
	- Divide by the smallest quantity
	- 12:22:11
	- But stay with the whole number
	- [[Empirical Formulas]]

## Changing a Subscript Makes a different compound

- $CO$ vs $\ce{ CO_{2} }$
- Very different compounds with different emergent properties
- $\ce{ CH_{4} + O_{2} -> CO + H_{2}O }$

## How to list the elements in order in compounds

- Chemicals list the most metallic elements first
- If there is not metallic element, the element closest to metals goes first
- In a single [[Element Groups]], the elements that are closer to the bottom are more metal-like

## Order the list the non metals elements in compounds

1. C
2. P

- To determine the total number of each type of atom in a compound containing a group within parentheses
- Multiply the subscript outside the parentheses by the subscript for each atom inside the parenthesis
- $\ce{ Mg^2- (OH)_{2} }$

## Determine the number of each type of atom in $Mg(NO_{3})_{2}$
