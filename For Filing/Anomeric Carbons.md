[[Anomers]] are cyclic [[Monosaccharides]] or [[Glycosides]] that are [[Epimers]], differing in the configuration of 1' C if they are [[Aldoses]], or 2' C if they are [[Ketoses]]. [[Epimers|Epimeric]] carbons in anomers are known as [[Anomeric Carbons]] or [[Anomeric Carbons|Anomeric Centers]].

[[Anomeric Carbons]] are swivels in [[Isomers]] of sugars where it can switch positions of the bonded atom or molecule to form Alpha or Beta [[Glycosidic Linkages|Glycosidic Bonds]].
