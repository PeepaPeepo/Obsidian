$$\ce{ HCl + Pepsinogen -> Gastric Juice }$$
$$\ce{ Gastric Juice + Food -> Chyme }$$
[[Gastric Juices]] are produced when $\ce{ HCl }$ and [[Pepsinogen]] react. Overall pH of 2, gastric juice helps denature [[Proteins]] and kill [[Microbes]]. The [[Stomach]] is lined with [[Mucus]] to prevent any damage, and Epithelial cells are reproduced about every three days. [[Chyme]] is the product of gastric juice and food.

[[Sphincters]] prevent gastric juice from entering or exiting the neighboring [[Esophagus]] and [[Small Intestine]].
