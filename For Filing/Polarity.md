- Polarity is a result of partial charges due to the difference of [[Electronegativity]] between [[Atoms]]
- The differences causes the shared [[Electrons]] to orbit around the most [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] atom in a [[Molecules]]
- The separation of partial charges create [[Dipoles]]
- Partial charges attract their respective charges, a common example is water
- Oxygen in a water molecule is partial negative, where Hydrogen is partially positive
- When adjacent to other water molecules, [[Hydrogen Bonds]] form
