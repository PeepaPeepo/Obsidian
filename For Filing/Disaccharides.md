- [[Disaccharides]] are formed when two [[Monosaccharides]] are covalently bonded through [[Glycosidic Linkages]], [[Dehydration Synthesis]] between specific carbons of [[Monosaccharides]]
- Two [[Glucose|Glucoses]] form the disaccharide [[Maltose|Maltose]], also known as malt sugar
- The most common [[Disaccharides]] is [[Sucrose]] which is [[Glucose]] and [[Fructose]]
- Sugar in milk, [[Lactose]] is [[Glucose]] and [[Galactose]]
- [[Disaccharides]] must be broken down into [[Monosaccharides]] to be used for energy
- The common formula for [[Disaccharides]] is Glucose + R
