Foger-Samwald, U. (2020). Osteoporosis Pathophysiology and therapeutic options

**Are osteocytes passive “bystanders” in the process of remodeling? Why or why not?**

1018. Osteocytes are former osteoblasts that become trapped in the bone matrix
1018. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-KB (RANK) and ligand is RANKL and is expressed by osteocytes by extra skeletal cells and tissues  
1019. Osteocytes are the most abundance cell type in bone and plays important role in bone and mineral homeostasis 
1019. Central role of as initiators and drivers of bone remodeling via communicating with osteoblasts and osteoclasts
1019. Communication facilitated by dendritic processes that span throughout the bone matrix
1019. Osteocytes directly influence osteoclast and osteoblast activity
