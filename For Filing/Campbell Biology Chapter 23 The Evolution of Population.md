[[Theory of Natural Selection|Natural Selection]] affects [[Populations]] over time
[[Individuals]] do not evolve but contain certain traits that may or may not help survival and reproduciton
[[Microevolution]] is a change in [[Alleles]] frequencies over in a population over generation
Three mechanisms that can influence microevolution are [[Theory of Natural Selection|Natural Selection]], [[Genetic Drift]], and [[Gene Flow]]

[[Evolutionary Trees]]
[[Homology]]

[[Convergent Evolution]]
[[Analogy]]

Species have common characteristics but different ancestors
Traits are analogous that are developed by environment

[[Fossils]]
[[Biogeography]] is the study of geographic distrubtion of species provides support for evolutions
Need to account for [[Pangaea]]

[[Scientific Theory|Theories]] accounts for many observations and data

[[Genes]] are located on [[Chromosomes]]
[[Chromosomes]] into [[Sister Chromatids]]
46 Chromosomes in humans
[[Homology]] chromosomes, one for each parent
Population can have many alleles for the same gene

[[Microevolution]] is the change of Allele frequencies in a population
[[Gregor Mednel]]
[[Phenotypes]] are the outward characteristics that can be observed
[[Genotypes]] is the actual code in the genes and allels

[[Gene Level]]
[[Heterozygosity]] is the percentage of heterozyougs loci
Its good to have a variety so the entire species doesn't get hit by rapid changes

[[Nucleotide Sequences]]
[[Nucleotide Variability]]
[[Intervening Sequences|Introns]]
[[Expressed Sequences|Exons]]
[[Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms}SNP]]
[[Phenotypic Variation]] can result from enviornmental influences as well as genetic differences
[[Epignetics]]

Srouces of genetic varation

[[Mutations]], [[Gene Duplications]]
[[Sexual Reproduction]] is the combination of existing alleles
[[Point Mutations]] or duplicate 
[[Recessive]] mutations can be hidden
[[Heterozygote Protection]] maintains a pool of allels that could be beneficial if the enviornment changes 
[[Neutral Variation]]

Mlticelluar organisms only mutations in cell lines produce gametes
[[Somatic Cells]] are not passed to offsprings
Everything except [[Gametes]] are [[Somatic Cells]]

Alternating Gene Number or Position

## Rapid Reproduction

Mutations are low in animals and plants averageing one in every 100k

[[Prokaryotes]] have lower rates but shorter generation times allow mutations to accumulate

Viruses due to short generation times and rapid mutation rates

## Sexual Reproduction

Combination of Alleles
[[Cross Over]]
[[Independent Assortment]]
[[Fertilization]]

[[Hardy-Weinberg Equation]] can be used to test whether a population is evolving
One or more factors that cause evolution must be at work for a population to evolve

## Gene Pools and Allele Frequencies

[[Populations]] is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area and interbreed, producing fertile offspring

Isolated populations rarely exchange genetic material

If populations are not isolated, individual still usually only breed with members of their own population

[[Gene Pool]] consists of all copies of every allele at every locus in all members of the population

Allele frequencies can also be calculated for a population
	Diploid organisms are the total number of allels at a locus is the total number of individuals times two
	Cout two dominant allels for each homozygous dominant indiivudal and one for each heterozygote
	The same logic applies for recessive alleles
Consider the population of 500 wildflowers with 320 red flowers
2 Alleles for each individual

By convetion if there are two allels at a locus, p and q are used to represent their frequenceies

The proportions of all allels in a population will ad up to 1

$$\ce{ p + q = 1 }$$
Population that is not evolving at a particular locus

If the observed genetic make up of the population differs from expectations under hardy weinberg

If the population is not evolving then the genotype and allele frequenceis will be constant from generation to generation

only mendelian segregation and recombination of allels occur for frequneceis to remain constant

such a population in hardy weinberg equilibrium and idea independently developed in 1908

[[Gene Pool]]

reproduction occurs by randomly selecting and combing allels from the bin

The frequency of genotypes can be calculated with the rule of miltiplication

$\ce{ C^RC^R = p * p = p^2 }$

The frequency of genotypes can be confirmed using a punnett square

$\ce{ p^2 + 2pq +q^2 }$

## Conditions for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium

For populations that are not evolving

Real populations do change over time

Conditions for hardy weinberg quilibirum

no mutations
	Gene pool is modified if mutations occur or if entire genes are deleted or duplicated
random mating
	If individuals mate within a subset of a population, such as near neighbors or close relatives
no natural selection
	allele frequencies change when individuals with diffferent genotype show consisten difference in their survival
no genetic drift
	frequencies can fluctuate
no gene flow

## Genetic Drift

[[Genetic Drift]] is a process in which chance events cause allele frequencies to fluctuate unpredictably from one generation to the next in **Small Populations**

Tends to reduce genetic variation through random loss

## The Founder Effect

[[Founder Effect]] occurs when a few individual become isolated from a larger population
Allele frequencies in smaller founder populations are different from those in parent populations
Founder effect accounts for the relatively high frequency of certain inherited disorders among isolated population

## Bottleneck Effect

[[Bottleneck Effect]] occurs when there is a drastic reduction in population size due to a sudden change in the environment
The surviving population can have a limited gene pool

## Effects of Genetic Drift

Happens in small populations
Drift can cause allele frequency at random
Drift can lead to. a loss of genetic varaition
genetic drift cause harmful allels to become fixed
Founder and bottleneck is an example of drift

## Gene Flow

[[Genes]] is the movement of alleles among populations
Can be transferred throguh movement of fertile individuals
Reduce genetic difference among populations over time
Can increase [[Fitness]] the ability to adapt to local conditions

## Natural selection is the only mechanism that consistetly causes adaptive evolution

Change and sorting
New genetic variation arise by chance
Beneficial alleles are sorted and favored by natural selection
natural selection leads to [[Adaptive Evolution]]

## Natural Selection: A Closer Look

There is no competition amongst individuals
Reproductive success is generally more subtle
[[Relative Fitness]] is the contribution an individual makes to the gene pool of the next generation

## Direction, Disruptive, and Stabilizing Selection

[[Directional Selection]] favors individuals at one extreme
[[Disruptive Selection]] favors individuals at both extremes

## The Key Role of Natural Selection in Adaptive Evolution

Octopus camouflage

## Sexual Selection

[[Sexual Selection]] is a process in which individuals with certain traits are more likely to obtain mates
[[Sexual Dimorphism]]

[[Intrasexual Selection]] is a direct competition among individuals of one sex
[[Intersexual Selection]] occurs when individuals of one sex are choosy

## Balancing Selection

[[Balancing Selection]] preserves variation at some loci by maintaing stable frequencies of two or more phentoypes

[[Frequncy-Dependent Selection]]
[[Heterozygote Proection]] have higher fitness than both

## The Sickle Cell Allele

## Why Natural Selection CAnnot Fashion Perfect Organisms

Works only on existing variation
Evolution is limited by histrocial constraints
adaptations are often compromises or tradfe ooffs
