[[Exploitation]] is a type of [[Interspecific Interactions]] where one party benefits from another party. Forms include [[Predation]], [[Herbivory]], and [[Parasitism]].

[[Predation]] assumes that one species completely kills their [[Prey]].
[[Herbivory]] assumes that one species consumes [[Kingdom Plantae|Plants]] or [[Algae]] without completely killing them.
[[Parasitism]] assumes the parasite takes nourishment from their host and can be either [[Endoparasites]] or [[Ectoparasites]].
