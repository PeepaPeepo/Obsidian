[[Regulators]] (animals) uses internal control mechanisms to internal change when facing external change
[[Conformers]] allow internal conditions to vary with certain changes
[[Homeostasis]] maintains a relatively constant internal environment regardless of external environment 
	[[Set Point]]
	[[Stimulus]] detected by [[Sensor]]
	[[Response]] to return variable to set point
[[Negative Feedback]] dampens [[Stimulus]] and plays major role in homeostasis
[[Positive Feedback]] amplifies stimulus and does not play a major role in homeostasis
[[Circadian Rhythms]] governs physiological changes that occur every 24 hours
[[Acclimatization]] can alter [[Homeostasis]] as an animal adapts to changes in External environment
[[Thermoregulation]] maintenance of internal temperature within normal range 
	[[Endothermy]] occurs when animals generate heat via [[Metabolism]]
	[[Ectothermy]] occurs when animals gain heat from external sources, includes fishes, amphibians, and nonavian reptiles, and most invertebrates
The thermostatic function of the [[Hypothalamus]] in human thermoregulation (Fig. 40.17) 
	[[Hypothalamus]] triggers heat loss or heat gaining mechanisms
		[[Fever]]

# Chapter 41 – Animal Nutrition  

[[Oral Cavity]] -> [[Esophagus]] -> [[Stomach]] -> [[Small Intestine]] ([[Duodendom]], [[Liver]], [[Pancreas]], [[Gallbladder]]) -> [[Large Intestine]] ([[Colon]], [[Rectum]], [[Caecum]], [[Appendix]]) -> Feces in [[Rectum]] released though [[Anus]]

Organs specialized for sequential stages of food processing form the mammalian digestive system
Secretion of digestive juices through ducts into the [[Alimentary Canal]]
Glands include [[Salivary Glands]], [[Pancreas]], [[Liver]], and [[Gallbladder]]
Food processing starts in the [[Oral Cavity]]
[[Salivary Glands]] deliver [[Saliva]] to lubricate food
[[Saliva]] contains [[Mucus]], water, salts, cells, and [[Glycoproteins]], and [[Amylase]]
Food is delivered through the junction, [[Pharynx]]
	Two outputs, [[Trachea]] and [[Esophagus]]
	Latter leading to the [[Stomach]]
	[[Epiglottis]] blocks entry to [[Trachea]] during swallowing actions
	[[Esophagus]]
		[[Peristalsis]] occurs within the esophagus to transfer food throughout esophagus to stomach
[[Sphincters]] are valves between compartments
[[Stomach]] stores food and processes it into a liquid suspension
	[[Gastric Juices]] are secreted and churned with food
	Gastric Juice + Food -> [[Chyme]]
	Gastric juice has a pH of 2 which can kill bacteria and denature proteins
	HCl + [[Pepsin]] -> Gastric Juice
	[[Pepsin]] is a [[Proteases]] that breaks [[Peptide Bonds]]
	[[Parietal Cells]] secrete hydrogen and chloride ions
	[[Chief Cells]] porduce [[Pepsinogen]] that react with HCl to form Pepsin
	Mucus protects stomach from Gastric Juice
	Cell division forms new epithelial layer every three days
[[Sphincters]] regulate transfers of food from eso to stomach to small intestine
[[Small Intestine]] is the longest compartment of the [[Alimentary Canal]]
	First portion is [[Duodendom]] 
		Chyme mixes with more juice from Pancreas, liver, gall bladder and small intestine 
		[[Pancreas]] provides [[Trypsin]] and [[Chymotrypsin]] protease and is a basic solution
		[[Bile]] helps digest fats, produced in [[Liver]] and grouped in [[Gallbladder]]
			It also destroys nonfunctional red blood cells
	Nutrient absorption occurs
	Large surface area via [[Microvilli]] and [[Villi]]
	Transport can be passive or active through Epithelial cells
		Like hairs made of hairs
	Absorption
		Epithelial cells absorb fatty acids and [[Monoglycerides]] and recombines into [[Fats|Triglycerides]]
		Then coated with [[Phospholipids]], [[Cholesterols]], and [[Proteins]] to form polar [[Chylomicrons]]
[[Liver]]
	[[Hepatic Portal Vein]] carries nutrient rich blood from capillaries of villi to liver to heart
	Regulates nutrient distribution
	Interconverts organic molecules
	Detoxifies organic molecules

[[Large Intestine]] is the ending of the [[Alimentary Canal]]
	Includes [[Colon]], [[Caecum]], and [[Rectum]]
	[[Colon]] leads to [[Rectum]] and [[Anus]]
	[[Caecum]] ferments plant material and joins small and large intestine
		Humans have extension called [[Appendix]]
	[[Colon]] completes recovery of water
	[[Feces]] become more solid as it passes through large intestine
	Lost of bacteria on poop
	[[Feces]] are stored in [[Rectum]] until released through [[Anus]]
	There are two sphincters between rectum and anus


- Digestive System Card Sort  
(https://www.biointeractive.org/classroom-resources/digestive-system-card-sort)  

# Chapter 42 – Circulation and Gas Exchange  

## Concept 42.2 Coordinated cycles of heart contraction drive double circulation in mammals

[[Cardiovascular System]] satisfies $\ce{ O_{2} }$ requirements
	[[Right Ventricle]] contraction pumps blood to lungs via [[Pulmonary Artery]]
		Blow flows through [[Capillary Beds]] in left and right lungs and loads $\ce{ O_{2} }$ and unloads $\ce{ CO_{2} }$
		Oxygen rich blood returns to [[Left Atrium]]
	[[Right Ventricle]] to capillaries in both lungs to left Left Atrium

### Mammalian Circulation

$\ce{ O_{2} }$ rich blood flows from [[Left Atrium]] to [[Left Ventricle]] then pumped to body tissue
	Exits Ventricle via [[Aorta]] that conveys blood to arteries leading throughout the body
	[[Aorta]] -> [[Arteries]] throughout body
		[[Coronary Arteries]] supply the heart muscles 
		[[Capillary Beds]] in Abdominal organs and hind limbs
		$\ce{ O_{2} }$ exchange with $\ce{ CO_{2} }$ with tissues
[[Capillaries]] rejoin to form [[Venules]] that convey blood to [[Veins]]
$\ce{ O_{2} }$ poor blood from head, neck, and forelimbs are channeled into [[Superior Vena Cava]]
[[Inferior Vena Cava]] drains blood from trunk and hind limbs
[[Superior Vena Cava]] and [[Inferior Vena Cava]] empty blood into the [[Right Atrium]]
Circuit completes to [[Right Ventricle]]

Starting with [[Right Ventricle]] pumps out O2 poor into lungs to recharge
Goes to left atrium to left ventricle to pump out O2 rich blood through out body transfered from aorta to arteries
	First pass is Coronary artiest to supply Heart
	Second pass are capillaries throughout the upper and lower body
Exhanges and reconvenes into Venules to veins to get to the right atrium to restar

Ventricles pump out
[[Atrium]] recieve
[[Aorta]] and [[Venules]] convey into [[Arteries]] and [[Veins]]

### A closer look

[[Cardiac Cycle]] is the rhythmic cycle of heart
Pumping is [[Systole]]
Relaxation is [[Diastole]]
[[Cardiac Output]] is the volume of blood pumped into systemic circulation
[[Heart Rate]] is bpm
[[Stroke Volume]] is amount of blood per pump
[[Atrioventricular Valves]] separate atrium and ventricles
[[Semilunar Valves]] control flow outside to aorta and pulmonary artery

# Chapter 44 – Osmoregulation and Excretion  

## Concept 44.4: The nephron is organized for stepwise processing of blood filtrate

[[Nephron]] is as functional unit of the [[Kidneys]]
	Filtrate produced in [[Bowman's Capsule]] contains salts, glucose, amino acids, vitamins, nitrogenous wastes, and other small molecules
About 1,600 L of blood flows through kidneys

### A Closer Look

#### Proximal Tubule

[[Proximal Tubule]] reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients
Molecules are transported actively and passively from filtrate into interstitial fluid and then capillaries

[[Nephron]] is a functional unit of a [[Kidneys]]
[[Kidneys]] can have over a million [[Nephron]] that is distributed through out the [[Renal Cortex]]
Most are [[Cortical Nephrons]] then remaining are [[Juxtamedullary Nephrons]]

[[Renal Veins]] and [[Renal Artery]] passes through [[Kidneys]]
[[Nephron]] filter blood and concentrated it, [[Ureter]] is the out put of kidneys

[[Nephron]] line the [[Kidneys]] [[Renal Cortex]]
[[Blood]] enters [[Bowman's Capsule]] and produces a filtrate
1.5 L of urine is transported to the bladder for excrete 
[[Proximal Tubule]] reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients
Molecules are transported from filtrate into [[Interstial Fluids]] then [[Capillaries]]
[[Filtrate]] passes through proximal tubule
Reabsorption of water occurs through channels made by [[Aquaporin]] 
Movement occurs through osmolarity\
Filtrate becomes concentrated
Salt is able to diffuse from tubule 
[[Distal Tubule]] regulates K+ and NaCl
H+ and HCO3-
Collecting Duct carries filtrate through the medulla to the renal pelvis
Reabosrption of solutes and water
Urine is Hyperosmotic to body fluids

# The Immune System  

Protection from [[Pathogens]]
Made of [[Immune Cells]]
	Travels through [[Blood Vessels]] and [[Lymphatic Vessels]]
Includes immune cell producing organs called [[Lymphoid Organs]]
[[Bone Marrow]], [[Lymph Nodes]], [[Spleen]], [[Thymus]], and [[Tonsils]]

## Barriers to Infection

[[Physical Barriers]]
	[[Skin]]
	[[Mucus]]
	[[Saliva]] and [[Sweat]] have [[Antibodies]]
	[[Gastric Juices]]
[[Chemical Barriers]]

## Bone Marrow

[[Bone Marrow]] produces [[Red Blood Cells]] and [[Immune Cells]] via [[STEM Cells]]
	Stem cells produce two [[Progenitor Cells]]
		[[Lymphoid Progenitors]]
			Produce [[Lymphocytes]]
				[[T Cells]] (***T***hymus and ***T***rigger, ***T***CR)
					Originates from [[STEM Cells]]  from bone marrow that produce [[Lymphocytes]]
					Develops in ***T***hymus
					Produces [[T Cell Receptors]] on surface
					Binds to [[Antigens]] from [[Pathogens]] to trigger an [[Immune Cells]]
					[[Self-Antigens]] are nonforeign
					It is indiscriminate, body terminates friendly casualties to prevent undesired response
				[[B Cells]] (lives in ***B***one marrow)
					Develops and functions in bone marrow, everything else leave and develop somewhere else
				[[Natural Killer Cells]]
		[[Myeloid Progenitors]]
			Produce [[Red Blood Cells]] and all other Immune Cells including [[Phagocytes]]

## Lymph Nodes

[[Lymph Nodes]] Found throughout body like blood vessels and connected by [[Lymphatic Vessels]]
[[Lymphatic Vessels]] are thin tubes that absorb fluid that leaks from blood vessels into tissues
Absorbed fluid is called [[Lymph]]
Travels through out [[Lymphatic Vessels]] and returns to blood
[[Pathogens]] can enter [[Lymphatic Vessels]] and travel to nodes
[[B Cells]], [[T Cells]], and [[Phagocytes]] can do their work in [[Lymph Nodes]]


## Spleen

[[Spleen]] removes old or damaged cells from [[Blood]]
	Contains [[Phagocytes]]
		[[Dendritic Cells]]
		[[Macrophages]]
		Both eat unwanted red blood cells 
	Contains [[B Cells]] and [[T Cells]]
	[[Spleen]] is removable and can be compensated by other lymphoid organs

## Immune Response

### First Responders

Main target are [[Pathogens]]
Can be recognized by [[Phagocytes]], [[Macrophages]] and [[Neutrophils]]
Both can recognize [[Antigens]]
[[Phagocytes]] perform [[Phagocytosis]] and destroys pathogen and damaged cells

### Inflammation

[[Pathogens]] trigger [[Inflammation]]
	[[Mast Cells]] release [[Histamine]] allows blood vessels to leak immune cells and fluid to infection site
	[[Macrophages]] release [[Cytokines]] to attract or activate [[Immune Cells]]
		Others can acivate cells that remove dead cells and repair damaged tissue
	Fluid build up at the site of infection
	Widespread can activate cyokines to raise body temp to cause fever
		Enhances immune cell activity and inhibit growth of pathogens
	Prolonged fever is bad for body

### Antiviral Defense

[[Natural Killer Cells]] target abnormal cells
	Infected and cancer cells
	Forces [[Apoptosis]] onto target
	Can cause [[Phagocytes]] that ate targets to go under [[Apoptosis]]

### Antigen Presentation 

[[Innate Immune Response]] triggers [[Adaptive Immune Response]]
Intermediate cells, [[Phagocytes]] that include [[Dendritic Cells]] and [[Macrophages]], can help the signal
[[Phagocytes]] displays [[Antigens]] of target on its surface via [[Major Histocompatibility Complex Proteins]] 
Those cells are [[Antigen-Presenting Cells]]
[[T Cells]] recognize those [[Antigen-Presenting Cells]] and ***T***riggers the [[Adaptive Immune Response]]

### Adaptive Immune Response

Initial response is the [[Innate Immune Response]] then follows [[Adaptive Immune Response]]
Several days may occur before adaptive stage starts
Targets specific Antigens
Utilizes [[Memory Cells]]
Two main Parts
	[[Cell-Mediated Immune Response]]
		Activated by T Cells
	[[Humoral Immune Response]]
		Activated by B Cells

### T-Cell Activation

[[T Cells]] can be found throughout [[Immune and Lymphatic Systems]] and blood, and [[Lymphoid Organs]]
[[T Cells]] need to encounter [[Antigen-Presenting Cells]] to trigger
Duplicates the complex rapidly
	Activated T Cells can either become [[Helper T Cells]] or [[Cytotoxic T Cells]]
		[[Cytotoxic T Cells]] forces [[Apoptosis]] on target
		[[Helper T Cells]] Activate [[B Cells]] and [[Cytotoxic T Cells]]
The chain reaction that causes [[Cytotoxic T Cells]] to destroy targets is the [[Cell-Mediated Immune Response]]

### Antibody Production

[[B Cells]] have [[B Cell Receptors]] that bind to one specific antigen
B Cells travel throughout body in blood and lymph
Concentrated in lymphoid organs
It can bind to its target Antigen
Then Activated by a Helper T Cell that recognizes the same
B cell can multiply into [[Plasma Cells]] that produce [[Antibodies]]
	[[Antibodies]] are produced and released from cells
		Can target specific antigen
		Can clump pathogens to prevent further infection
		Then Eaten by phagocytes
		Can neutralize [[Toxins]]
		Activates [[Complement Proteins]]
This process is the [[Humoral Immune Response]]

### Memory

Most B and T Cells die after infection
Some remain in low levels and are called [[Memory Cells]]
They can be reactivated to multiply

### Vaccines

Trigger [[Primary Immune Response]] without causing infection or disease
Produces [[Memory Cells]]
[[Secondary Immune Response]]
Four main introductions
	[[Live-Attenuated Vaccines]]
		Weak form of pathogen
	[[Inactivated Vaccines]]
		Dead or inactive form of Pathogen
	[[Subunit Vaccines]]
		Specific piece of pathogen such as a part of a [[Proteins]]
	[[Toxoid Vaccines]]
		Inactivated [[Toxins]] of pathogen
