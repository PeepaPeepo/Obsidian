[[Strong Bases]] are substances that completely [[Ionization|ionize]] in [[Aqueous Solutions]] and typically produce $\ce{ OH- }$ ions. If the substance doesn't disassociates 100%, it is classified as [[Weak Bases]].

Strong bases include $\ce{ LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH, Mg(OH)2, Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, Ba(OH)2 }$.

These are compounds containing [[Alkali Metals|Group 1A]] and [[Alkaline Earth Metals|Group 2A]] [[Metals]] excluding H, Be, Fr, and Ra.
