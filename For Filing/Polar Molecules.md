 - Polar molecules are composed of at least two [[Atoms|atoms]] that are varied in [[Electronegativity|electronegativity]], and causes an imbalance of shared [[Electrons]] 
 - Electrons tend to gravitate towards the atom that is the most electronegative

# Question

## Do electronegative atoms that gain an electron cause it to become negative due to the electrons outnumbering the originals protons? 

No, difference in relative electronegativity between two atoms causes the shared electron to gravitate to the more electronegative atom causing a partial charge.

- Oxygen has 8 protons and gains two electrons from 2 Hydrogens
	- 8 proton to 10 electron
- Hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 electron
	- 1 proton to 0 electron
