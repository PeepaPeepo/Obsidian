[[Bohr Model]] states that [[Electrons]] travel arounds the [[Atomic Nucleus]] in circular orbits similar to planet orbits.

The model includes the [[Atomic Nucleus]] surrounded by [[Bohr Orbitals]] which are classified by [[Quantum Numbers]].

This model was replaced by the [[Quantum-Mechanical Model]] because it wasn't able to predict characteristics of complex [[Atoms]] past [[Hydrogen]].
