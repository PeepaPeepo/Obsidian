1. You will have 15 multiple choice questions (7/8 questions from each chapter, theoretical concepts from the two chapters);
	1. Look at Chapter 2 and 3 Overview View
	2. [[Introductory Chemistry Chapter 2 Measurements and Problem Solving Overview]]

# 2 writing numbers in both decimal and scientific notation to the correct number of sig. figures;

# 2 significant number questions in calculations involving addition/subtraction and multiplication/division;

# [[SI Units]] Memorize all prefixes, other equalities will be given

[[Table 2.2 SI Prefix Multipliers - Metric Conversion.png]]

## Derived units

$\ce{ 1 cm^3 = 1 mL }$  

# Memorize the equalities between J, cal, and Cal

$\ce{ 4.184 J = 1 cal }$
$\ce{ 1000 cal = 1 Cal }$

# Memorize the equality relationship among $^oF$, $^oC$ and K

$\ce{ ^oC = \frac{^of-32}{1.8} }$
$\ce{ ^oF = ^oC*\frac{9}{5} +32 }$
$\ce{ K = ^oC - 273.15 }$

# 2 heat capacity and temperature change calculations formula will be provided

$heat\ =\ mass\ *\ specific\ heat\ capicity *\ temperature\ change$
$q = m * C * \Delta T$
