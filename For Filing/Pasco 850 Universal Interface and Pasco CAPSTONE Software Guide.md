Sensor's connectors are connected to either digital or analog inputs
Sensors are not automatically assigned when connected

# Setting up the PASCO Motion Sensor II (CI-6742A)

Motion sensor may have yellow and black male ends, yellow is plugged into Digital input 1 and remaining goes to input 2

For motion sensor, create a position vs time and velocity and time graph. Select two display's icon
To setup each display, click on the icons; options includes tables, but most likely graphs will be picked for motion

Afterwards set up hardware, under "tools", select "Hardware Setup"
Options of IO ports are clickable, then assigned to desired hardware

For each graph, click on x or y axis to assign measurements
For y axis for position and select the motion sensor

Repeat for remaining graph for Velocity

To record data, press record, then stop when desired
Default sample rate is 20 hz, and can be changed if desired

Motion sensor has 2 settings, large or small target switch

There is as scale to fit for display at top left of graph

# Alignment of the PASCO Motion Sensor II (CI-6742A) when using the air cart

Switch motion sensor to cart icon

Flag should be oriented perpendicular to long-axis of air track to create a surface for motion sensor to bounce off

Open a new page and click and drag a digits displace on to page

Bring cart close to motion sensor and aim sensor until centered on to flag
Note flag position on track ruler vs digital reading

Common mistakes include motion sensor is aimed too low and rebound off the cart and not the flag
