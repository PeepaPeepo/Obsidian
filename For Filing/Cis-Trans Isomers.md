- An [[Isomers|isomer]] based on a pair [[Double Covalent Bonds|double bonded]] carbons
- The double bond gives the molecule a rigid property
- The following atoms connected to the double bonded carbon exist in the same plane
- Depending on the distribution of [[Atoms|atoms]] relative to the double bonded carbons, it can form a Cis- or Trans-Isomer
- If a pair of atoms or molecules are on adjacent 'corners' relative to the double bonded carbon they are Cis-Isomers
- If a pair of atoms or molecules are on opposing 'corners' relative to the double bonded carbon, it is a Trans-Isomer
