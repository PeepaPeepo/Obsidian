[[Molecular Compounds]] are [[Compounds]] or [[Molecules]] that only contain [[Nonmetals]], which can be found in Group 4A - 5A of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]. [[Noble Gases]] are not included because they cannot form [[Chemical Bonds]] due to their complete [[Valence Shells]].

# Binary Molecular Compound Nomenclature

The naming of [[Binary Molecular Compounds]] involve giving [[Constituent Elements]] [[Numeral Prefixes]] and changing the ending of the last [[Constituent Elements]] in the molecule to -ide. [[Numeral Prefixes]] include di-,tri-, hypo-, and per-. 



# Summary
