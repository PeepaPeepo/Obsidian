[[Speciation]] is the process which one species splits into two species
It explains the many features that organisms share because they descended from one common ancestor

[[Allopatric Speciation]] gene flow is interrupted when a population is divded into geographically isolated subpopulations
Examples include split through phsyical obstales such as water or lakes
It can also occur when inidivudals colonize a remote area and their descendants become isolated from parent population
Examples include flightless cormorants entering galapagos islands
Rats in new york city

Different mutation arise and natural selection and [[Genetic Drift]] may alter allele frequencies in different ways that other separated popultiations

little or no gene flow currently occur between ponds

# Evidence of Allopatric Speciation

Reproductive barriors can develope
Some shrimp cannot populate from each other 
biologcial vs geographic isolated barriers

# Sympatric Speciation

[[Sympatric Speciation]] occurs in populations that live in teh same geographic area
Constant contact and geneflow
can occur if gene flow is reduced by such factors such as polyploidy, sexual selection, and habitat differentiation

[[Polyploids]] extra set of chromosomes durring cell division error
ocassionally happens in animals

# Homologies

Similarity resulting from common ancestry is [[Homology]]
[[Homologous Structures]]
[[Vestigial Structures]]
[[Evolutionary Trees]]

[[Analogy]] and [[Convergent Evolution]]
Share similar traits but do not come from same ancestor

# Mechanism of Evolution

## Genetic Drift

The process in which chance events cause unpredictable fluctuation in allele frequency
Mostly in smaller populations 
important aspect of genetics drift is is caused by chance events

[[Founder Effect]] smaller group starts an isolated population with new gene pool
[[Bottleneck Effect]] size of population reduces, and the remaining organisms creates a new limited gene pool

Significant in small populations
causes allele frequency to change at random

## Natural Selection

process in which individuals with certain inherited tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates
Morphological traits
evolution with accumulation of differences from ancestors
happens at population level
[[Adaptive Evolution]] which traits enhance survival and reproduction increase in frequency over time

##  Gene Flow in a Population

Movement of alleles among population
keeps different populations of species together
tends to reduce genetic drift difference
adaptation to local environments 

## Gene Flow and Fitness

incerase fitness, the abilit to adapt to local conditions
[[Relative Fitness]] contribution this individual twoward gene pool

## Mutations

Permanent change in dna sequence

point
silent mutation
missience mutation change of an amino
nonsense stop codon
frameshift off set by not a multiple of 3

Species are grouped together by common characteristics

legless lizards don't share full traits of common snakes

[[Phylogeny]]

[[Systematics]] classify organisms

## Hierarchical classification

Taxonomic groups from broad to narrow
domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species

## Phylogenetic Tree

Evolutionary tree
Hyptohesis common ancestral origin

monophyletic group is one whole group, called a Clade
[[Monophyletic Groups]]
[[Paraphyletic Groups]]
[[Polyphyletic Groups]] many groups with atleast 1 uncommon ancestor

# Natural Selection 

## Directional Selection

[[Directional Selection]] conditions favor indivials one extreme photpic range
Common when environment changes or when members of population migrate to new or different habitat

One extreme phenotype is favored
Example one color over another color

[[Stabilizing Selection]] against extreme and favors intermediate
[[Disruptive Selection]] conditions favor both extremes and not intermediate

[[Sexual Selection]] attraction of mates to each in order to gain traits that enhance species survival

Intrasexual selection, same sex fights for opposite sex mate
