## What adaptatiosn have enabled seed plants to make up

[[Seeds]] have Embyro and nutrients surrounded by protective coat
Seeds can disperse over long distances by wind or other means

# Concept 30.1 Seeds and Pollen grains are key adaptions for life on lnad

seed plants have reduced gametophytes, heteroyspory, ovules, and pollen
Copes with drought and UV radiation

## Advantages of Reduced

[[Sporophyte]] Dominant 
Developed spores retained within the sporgangia of th sporo phyte
protected from envir
Pollen Cone vs Ovulate Cone

## Heterospory: The Rule Among Seed Plants

[[Homosporous]] plants produce one kind of spore
[[Heterosporous]] plants produce two types of spores which form either male or female
Ferns are relatives of seed plants
Spores developed on [[Sporophylls]]
[[Megasporophylls]] bear produce femable gametophyte

## Ovules and Production of Eggs

[[Ovule]] consists of a megaspore within a mega sporangium and protective coats called [[Integuments]]
Major difference in Gmno and Angio are seed layers

## Pollen and Production of Sperm

[[Pollen Grain]]
[[Pollination]] is the tranfer of poollen ot the part of seeed plant containing the ovules
Pollen can be transferred long distances by wind or animals
Germinated pollen gain produce a [[Pollen Tubes]]

## Evoluationary Advantages of Seeds

[[Zygotes]] grows into sprophyte embryo
ovule develops into a [[Seeds]] with a food supply packaged in a protectvie coat
Both seeds and spores provide proection from harse conditions and facilitiate dispersal

Seeds are multicelluar vs spore uni
Seeds can remain dormant for years
Seeds have stored food
Seeds can be transpored by longer distances by wind or animals

# Concept 30.2: Gymnosperms bear naked seeds, typcially on cones

Usually forms cones
Most gymnosperms are cone bearing plantsa called [[Conifers]]

## The Life Cycle of a Pine

Pine tree produces a [[Sporangia]] in male and female cones
Pollen cones are small and consists of [[Microsporophylls]] that bear
Ovulate cones are larger and consists of modded stem stissues and [[Megasporophylls]] bearing [[Megasporangia]]

Takes nearly three years from the time the cones first appear to produce mature seeds

## Old Gymnosperms

305 million years ago
Replaced with seedless vascualr plants in the drying climate of the late carboniferious period
Seeds, pollen, and adaptaitons for drough tolerance
gymnosperms dominated terrestial ecosytesm
served as food for herb dino
angiosperms took over
gymnosperms pollinated by insects

## Diversity

350 living species have large cones and palm like leaves
unlike most seed plants, they have flagellated sperm

Phlyum Ginkgophyta

*Ginkgo biloba* is the only linving specieis in this group
Flagellated sperm
Tolerate pollution well
Fleshy seed produce by female tree smell rancid as they decay

Phylum Gnetophyta
Three Genera: Gnetum, Ephedra, and Welwitschia
Deserts of southwestern africa
live for thousands of years
produce strap like leaves

*Gnetum* includes about 35 species of tropical trees, shrubs, and vines

Produeces [[Ephedrine]] used as decongestant

Phylum Coniferophyta

600 Species
Largest phylum
Woody cones and some have felshy cones

[[Evergreens]] and retain leaves year round
[[Deciduous]] species shed leaves

# Concept 30.3 Reproductive adaptations of angio sperms inlcude flowers and fruits

All belong to [[Anythophyta]]
[[Angiosperms]] are seed plants with reproductive structures called [[Flowers]] and [[Fruits]]
[[Monophyletic Groups]]
[[Gymnosperms]] have [[Polyphyletic Groups]]

## Flower

Specialized for reproduction
Wind pollination

Floral organs

[[Sepals]]
[[Petals]] atrract pollinators
[[Stamens]] Microsporophylls, male
[[Carpels]] megasporophylls, female
Phylls are leaves 

[[Stamens]] have [[Filaments]] and [[Anthers]]
Microspores develop into [[Pollen Grain]] which are male gametophytes
[[Carpels]] consists of an [[Ovary]] at the base pf a [[Style]] leading to a sticky [[Stigma]]

Variable in shape, size, color, and odor

Fused petals

## Fruits

As seeds develop, the ovary wall thickens and the ovary matures into a [[Fruits]]
Mature fruits can be either fleshy or dry

Adaptations to disperse seeds
Dandelions have structures like parashoots
Coconuts are adapted to float 
Burrs cling to animal fur
Sweet fruits are eaten by animals and dispersed in feces

## Angiosperm life cycle

Male [[Gametophytes]] are contained within pollen grains produced by [[Microsporangia]] of [[Anthers]]
[[Ovule]] develops within the [[Ovary]] and contains a female [[Gametophytes]], also called an [[Embryo Sac]]

Fertilized ovule matures into a seed
Zyogte forms a sporophyte embry with a simple root and one or two [[Cotyledons]]
[[Endosperm]] triploid cell
[[Germinate]]

## Angiosperm Evolution

Suddenly appeared about 100 million years ago
Do not understand how angiosperms arose
Originated in early Cretaceous period

[[Monocots]] have one cotyledon organs in 3
[[Dicots]] have two cotyledons
[[Eudicots]] are true dicots from clade that includes most of hte species one categoriized as dicots, organs in five

[[Basal Angiosperms]] include plants belonging to the oldest lieages, *Amborella* like water lilies
About 100 species composing three small lineages constitute the basal angiosperms 

[[Magnoliids]] share some traits wtih basal angiosperms but evolved later
Consists of about 8,500 species including both woody and herbaceous
They share some traits with vasal angiosperms such as spirally arranged floral organs

## Monocots

1/4 of angio sperms are about 72,000 species
Largest groups are the orchids, graasses, and palm
Grasses include some of the most agricultutral important crops, such as maize, rice, and wheat

## Eudicots

More than 2/3 angio sperms, roughly 210,000
Largest group is the legume family including crops such as peas and beans

# Concept 30.4: Human Welfare depends on seed plants

Sources of food, fuel, wood

## Products from Seed Plants

80% calofies come from wheat, rice, maize, potatoes, cassava, and sweet protatoes
Also feeds livestock using 5 - 7 kg of grains needed to produce 1 kg of grain fed beef
Modern crops are products of relatively recent genetic change from artifical selction
NUmber and size of seeds are greater in domesticated plants comared to wiled relatives

Tea, coffee, chocolate, and spices
Sources of wood, fuel, paper, constructiosn
Medicinally active compoudjs in seeed plants are used directly or synthesized to produce medicine

## Threats to Plant Diversity

[[Habitat Destruction]] treatenings plants species worldwide
Loss of plant species is often accompanied by the loss of insects and other animals they support

# Concept 30.3 The reproductive adaptations of angiosperms include flowers and fruits

[[Angiosperms]] are flowering plants with seeds
Reproductive structures are [[Flowers]] and [[Fruits]]
Greek *angion*, container refers to seeds contained in fruits
Most diverse and wide spread of all plants with about 290,000 or 90% of plant species

## Characteristics of Angiosperms

Angiosperms are classified in single [[Phyla|Phylum]] [[Anthophyta]]

## Flowers

[[Flowers]] are unique angiosperm structures specialized for sexual reproduction
Transfer of [[Pollen]]
Specialized shoot that can have up to four types of modified leaves
[[Floral Organs]]: [[Sepals]], [[Petals]], [[Stamens]], [[Carpels]]
[[Sepals]] are green and encloses the flower before opening
[[Petals]] are the interior brightly colored and attracts [[Pollinators]]
Sepals and petals are sterile

[[Stamens]] and [[Carpels]] are modified leaves for reproduction
[[Stamens]] are [[Microsporophylls]] that produce [[Microspores]] that develop into [[Pollen Grain]] which contains male [[Gametophytes]]
They have a stalk called the [[Filaments]] and [[Anthers]], a terminal sac where pollen is produced

[[Carpels]] are [[Megasporophylls]]: produces female [[Gametophytes]]
Contains seeds
[[Carpels]] have a sticky [[Stigma]] and receives pollens
Then it contains a [[Style]] that leads the stigma to the ovary

Fowers can have one or more carpels
[[Simple Pistil]] is one carpel 
[[Compound Pistil]] are two or more fused carpels

## Stomata

Density under both genetic and environmental control

Mechanisms of Stomatal opening an closing
Changes in Turgor pressure open and close tomata

When turgid, guard cells bow outward and the pore between them opens
WHen flaccid guard cells become less bowed and the pore closes

## Stimuli

Light sensitivitiy
CO_2 Depletion
Internal clock
[[Circadian Rhythms]]

Effects of transpiration on wiling and leaf temperature

Sunny, warm, dry, and windy ocnditons cause different transpiration rates to increase
Insufficient to replace water, plant will wilt

## Adaptations that reduce evaporative water loss

Water availability is a major determinat of plant produccity
Free water is required to uptake CO_2
[[Xerophytes]] have morphological or physiological adaptations to reduce water loss
[[Crassulacean acid metalbolism]] (CAM) close during the day and open for gas exhange at night

[[Photosynthesis]] vs [[Cellular Respiration]]
