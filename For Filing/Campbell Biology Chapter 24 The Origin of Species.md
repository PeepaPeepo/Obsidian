## How do new species originate from existing species

[[Speciation]] the process by which one species split into two or more species
[[Diversity of Life]] and [[Unity of Life]]

Populations connected by [[Gene Flow]]
If a population isolates it can diverge genetically

[[Biological Species Concept]] potential to interbreed in nature
Not based on physical or morphological similarity

## Reproductive Isolation

[[Reproductive Isolation]] results when biological barriers impede members of two species from interbreeding and producing viable fertile offspring
[[Hybrids]]
[[Prezygotic Barriers]]
	Habitat Isolation
	Temporal Isolation
	Behavioral Isolation
	Mechanical Isolation
		Physically cannot connect
	Gametic Isolation
		Incompatibilitiy
[[Postzygotic Barriers]]
	Reduced hybrid Viability
		Hybrids don't live long
	Reduced hybrid fertility
		Low rates
	Hybrid breakdown

[[Morphological Species Concept]]
	Definition based on structural features
[[Ecological Species Concept]]
	Species by ecological niche
	Applies to sexual and asexual species and emphasizes the role of disruptive selection 

## Speciation can take place with or without geographic separation

[[Allopatric Speciation]] geographic isolation
[[Sympatric Speciation]] populations are not geographically isolated

## The process of allopatric speciation

Effect of geographic barrier depends on the ability of organics to more about
Canyon may create a barrier
The gene pools of isolated populations may diverge through mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift
reproductive isolation may arise by product of genetic divergence

## Allopatric Other Country Speciation

## Sympatric Same Country Speciation

[[Sympatric Speciation]] speciation occurs in populations that live in the same area

# 02/05/2024 Zoom Lecture

[[Sympatric Speciation]], both species are located i n the same places
Less common thant allopatric

## Polyploidy

Accidents during cell divison can cause [[Polyploids]], the presences of extra sets of chromosomes
Can form a new new species within a single gnerations without geographic spearation

## Autopolyploids

Have more than two sets of chromosomes all from one single speices
Plants mitotic errors can result in production of a tetraploid from a diploid
Fertile offspring can be produce through self fertilzation or mating among tetraploids
mating between tetraploids and diploids produces triploids off spring with reduced fertility

## Polyploidy

[[Allopolyploids]] have more tha ntwo sets of chromosomes, derived from diffirent species
Chromosomes from different

## Autopoloyploidds

diploid -> tetraploid cell caused by cell divison eorror 
- meisos 
- tetraploid cells will craete diploids instead of haploids

Diploid cells from species A, diploid from species B
Sterile hybrid zygotes
Mitotic or meiotic error in a hybrind plant cell doublesthe chromosomes numbers

Diploid cells from new species, viable, feritle allopolyploids

Commone with plants

Oats, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, and wheat are polyploidy
Bread wheat T. Aestovum bread wheat

New polyploid agricultural species are produced using chemical to induce eorrors in cell division

uses chemicals to induce errors in cell division

## Sexual Selections

[[Sympatric Speciation]] can be driven by sexual selection
Speciate of cichlids in lake victoria as likely driven by female mate choice based on male breeding coloration
Based on species differentiation

Sexual Selection vs Natural Selection

Natural selectio ncaused by nature

Sexual selection is determined by choice of female of species

## Habitat Differentiation

[[Sympatric Speciation]] cana result from exploitation of new habititats or resrouces
Apple maggot flies evolved in north america after swtiching hosts from hawthron to apple
Maggot flies mate on their host plant, resulting i nhabitat isolation between groups using different hosts

## Concept 24.3 Hybrid zones reveal factors that cause repoductive isolation

[[Hybrid Zone]] is a region in which members of diferent species mate and produce hybird offspring
[[Hybrids]] are results of bating between species with incomplete repdocutive barrios
Reduced survival and reproduction compared to parents
Gene flow may be inmpeeded by obstactes sujch as natural selection
Novel hybrid zones are induced by [[Climate Change]]

# Reinforcment: Strengthening Reproductive Barriors

If Hybrids are less fit than the parent species, then strong selection for prezygotic barriers should reduce hybrid production
[[Reinforcement]] reinforces repdroductive barriors
should be stronger for sympatric than allo patric populations

## Fusion: Weakening Reprodutive Barriers

Substantial gene flow betwee nspeciers if hybrids are as fit as their partents
Reproducte barriors can weakn
Tow parent species may be lost when fusing

# Stability: Contintued formatio nof hybrid idividuals

Gene flow from outside the hybrid zone can overhwelm selection for increase reproductive isolation inside the hybrid zone

## Concepts 24.4 Speciation can occur rapidly or slowly and can result from changes in few or many genes 

Speciation was better understood when he relaized teh eovlution by natural selection helped explained bot hthe diversty of life and the adaptitioons of organisms

Unknown time to change

## The time course of speciation

Observing broad patterns i nthe fossile record

morpholocial and molecular data can be also used to assess the time internval between speciation events in particular groups

## Sepciation Rates

[[Punctuated Pattern]] suggests that speciation can be rapid
Divergence is the accumulation of mutations that makes it different from parent species
[[Speciation Events]] ranged from 4,000 to 40 million years for beetles

## Studying the grenetics of speciation

Speciation might requried change in a single gene or many geens
The direction of shell spiral affects mating and is controlled by a single gene
Monkey flowers have atleast two loci affect flower color which influences pollinator preference
In other organisms, speciation can be influenced by larger number of genes and gene interactions
Few or many genes can influence the evolution of reproductive isolation

## From Speciation to macroevolution

Difference accumulate with succesive speciation events, eventualyl new grups of organisms from that different greatly from their ancestors

Other groups shrink in size as species are lost to extinction

[[Macroevolution]] is a the cumulative effect of many speciation and extinction events
