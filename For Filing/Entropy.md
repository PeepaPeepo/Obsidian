$$\ce{ S }$$

[[Entropy]] is a measure of [[Molecules|Molecular]] disorder and measured in [[joules]] or [[Kelvin]].

Is a thermodynmaic function that increases as the number of energyetically erquivalent ways of arranging the components increases

Units of J/mol

S = k in W
k = [[Boltzmann Constant]] = 1.38 * 10^-23
Random systems require less energy than ordered systems
