[[Plasmids]] are small, circular pieces of DNA that replicate independently of the host chromosome.


Plasmids have  
revolutionized molecular biology by allowing investigators to obtain many copies of custom DNA molecules.  
In this lab, you will isolate plasmids from non-pathogenic strains of _Escherichia coli_, which you will use  
in subsequent experiments to transform _Saccharomyces cerevisiae met_ strains.
