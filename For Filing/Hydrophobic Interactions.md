- Water $H_{2}O$ does not form [[Hydrogen Bonds]] between [[Nonpolar]] [[Molecules]], due to the lack of partial charges
- Hydrophobic Interactions prevent water to dissolve nonpolar molecules such as [[Lipids]]
- These interactions are useful in [[Membranes]] to protect [[Hydrophilic]] [[Molecules]]
