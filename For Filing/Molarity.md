The number of [[Moles]] of [[Solubility|solute]] dissolved in one liter of [[Solutions|solution]]. To calculate the molarity of a solution, divide the moles of solute by the volume of the solution expressed in liters.

$$\ce{ Molarity(M) = \frac{moles of solute}{liters of solution} }$$

# Uses

- Essential for making solutions such as [[1X TAE Buffer]] or [[1X 50 TAE Buffer]]
