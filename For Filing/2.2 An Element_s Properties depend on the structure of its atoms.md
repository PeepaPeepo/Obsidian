# Previous Chapter

[[2.1 Matter consists of chemical elements in pure form and in combinations called compounds]]

# Page Reference

- Page 30

# Introduction

- Each element is made of a unique [[Atoms]]
	- Smallest unit of matter that retains element characteristics
	- Abbreviations used for elements are also for a single element atom

## Example

- $C$ is Carbon, and a single $C$ atom

# Subatomic Particles

- Atoms are the smallest units that preserve element characteristics, but atoms are still made of [[Subatomic Particles]]
- Physicists were able to create 100 types of particles from particle collider
- Important parts of atoms are [[Neutrons]], [[Protons]], and [[Electrons]]
	- Protons and electrons are electrically charged
- Each proton has one unit of positive charge
- Each electron has one unit of negative charge
- Neutrons are electrically neutral
- Protons and neutrons are packed in a dense core called an [[Atomic Nucleus]]
- Rapid electrons form a cloud around the atomic nucleus creating a cloud of negative charge
- attraction between the electrons and protons maintain the cloud
- Review Atom diagram

- Neutrons and Protons are identical in mass
	- about $1.7*10^{24}g$
- Unit of measure for atoms and subatomic particles is dalton
	- Named after John Dalton
- Alternate units for a dalton is [[Atomic Mass Units]]
- Mass of an electron is 1/2000 of a neutron/proton
- Omit electron mass during computation
# Atomic Numbers and Atomic Mass (31)

- All elements have a unique number of [[Subatomic Particles]]
- Atoms of the same [[Elements|element]] will have the same number of [[Protons]]
- The number of protons and element has is called an [[Atomic Number]]
	- Written in subscript left of the element symbol
- $_2HE$ means it has 2 protons, and it implies they are neutral unless otherwise stated
	- It needs the respective amount of [[Electrons]] to balance the charge
- The atomic number states the number of proton/electron in a neutral atom
- Number of neutrons can be calculated from the [[Mass Numbers]]
	- Total number of protons and neutrons in an [[Atomic Nucleus]]
	- Written as a super script left of the element in question
	- Neutrons can be found by the difference of the atomic number and the mass number
- Electron mass is small in comparison, it doesn't affect net mass
- Neutrons and Protons have a mass very close to 1 dalton
- Different from the [[Atomic Masses]]

## Example

$^{23}_{11}Na$

- Mass number is 23
	- The total number of protons and neutrons
- Atomic Number is 11
	- The total number of electrons in a neutral atom
- Number of protons is the difference between mass number and atomic number

# Isotope (31)

- Some [[Atoms|atoms]] can have different ratios of [[Subatomic Particles]]
- Some can have more [[Neutrons]], and it increases mass
- The different forms are called [[Isotopes]]
	- It's a variance of form of an atom
	- Carbon can come in different masses
	- but it will always need 6 protons to be a Carbon
- carbon $^{12}C$ and $^{13}C$ are stable
	- They do not decay, or lose subatomic particles
- $^{14}C$ is not stable, it is radioactive
- [[Radioactive Isotope]] are atoms were its [[Atomic Nucleus]] can spontaneously decay
- If the atom changes in protons, it will change its element

# Radioactive Tracers (31)

- Radioactive isotopes are used in medical diagnostic tools
- Cells can used radioactive atoms like non-radioactive ones
- Radioactive cells are incorporated in bio active molecules
- Used as tracers to track metabolism
- Kidney disorders are monitored with tracer molecules excreted in urine
- PET scanners monitor cancer metabolisms
- decaying isotopes can damage cells
- Nuclear fallout is bad

# Radiometric Dating (32)

- [[Parent Isotope]] decays into a [[Daughter Isotope]] at a fixed rate
- Expressed as [[Half-Life]]
	- The time it takes to decay to half of its life
	- isotope characteristic not affected by other variables like temp, pressure, or other environmental variable
- Measures different isotopes and calculate how many half-lives years have passed since a fossil or rock has been formed
- Half Lives vary by isotope
- Uranium-238 has half life of 4.5

# The Energy Levels of Electrons (32)

- During chemical reactions, atomic nuclei don't even come close to each other
- Mostly electrons interact
- Atom's electrons have different Energy levels
- [[Energy]] is the capacity to change
- [[Potential Energy]] is energy matter posses because of its location or or structure
- Electrons have potential energy due to its attraction to protons/positively charged nucleus
- ![[Pasted image 20230827192929.png]]
- The greater distance from nucleus, the more potential energy an electron has
- Changes of potential energy changes in fixed amounts
- electrons can only exist at certain energy levels
- Electron energy level is based on distance from [[Atomic Nucleus]]
- Electrons can be found at a different [[Electron Shells]]
	- Each have average distance and energy level
	- An electron can change shells only if it receives or gives energy equal to the difference of the shells
	- When electron absorbs energy  it moves away from the nucleus
- Light is source of energy that can move electrons
- When a nucleus looses energy, it's released to the environment has visible or uv radiation

# Electron Distribution and Chemical Properties

- Chemical behavior is depended on distribution of electrons in its shells
- [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]
	- Arranged in 3 rows or periods
	- Based on the electron shells in their atom
- Electrons like to stay in the lowest energy
- First shell cannot hold more than 2 electrons
- When a shell is full, the remainder goes to the next shell
- second shell holds 8 electrons
- Chemical behavior depends on the number electrons in the outermost shell
	- They are called [[Valance Electrons]] in the [[Valence Shells]]
	- 
- Atoms with same number of electrons in valence shells share similar chemical behavior
	- Cl and F have 7 valence electrons
	- Both can bind with Na
- Atom with completed valance shell is unreactive
	- will not react with other atoms
- Helium, Neon, and Argon are the only complete valence shell electrons
	- they are [[Inert]]
- All other atoms are chemically reactive because incomplete valance shells

# Electron Orbitals

- The 3d space where electron is found is called the [[Quantum-Mechanical Orbitals]]
- Each electron shell has its own orbit
	- First shell (1s)- one spherical s orbital
	- Second Shell (2s) - Spherical and 3 dumbbell shaped p orbital
	- Third Shell (3s) - s, p orbital plus more
- 
![[Figure 2.8 Electron Orbitals.png]]

- No more than 2 electrons can occupy a single orbital per shell
- Second shell orbital is x,y,z, and s. = 2 each axis = 8 total electrons
- Reactivity comes from unpaired electrons in one or more orbitals in the valance shell
- 

#  CONCEPT CHECK 2.2
## 1. A lithium atom has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. What is its
mass number?

3 + 4 =7 

## 2. A nitrogen atom has 7 protons, and the most common isotope of nitrogen has 7 neutrons. A radioactive isotope of nitrogen has 8 neutrons. Write the atomic number and mass number of this radioactive nitrogen as a chemical symbol with a subscript and superscript.

$^{15}_{7}N$

## 3. How many electrons does fluorine have? How many electron shells? Name the orbitals that are occupied. How many electrons are needed to fill the valence shell?

- 2 Electron Shells
- Valance Shell is 2s
	- 2s s, and 2s p is occupied
	- Valance electron is 7 like 
	- You need 1 more to fill

## 4. VISUAL SKILLS In Figure 2.7, if two or more elements are in the same row, what do they have in common? If two or more elements are in the same column, what do they have in common?
For suggested answers, see Appendix A

- Same row is number of shells
- each column has same number of valance electrons
