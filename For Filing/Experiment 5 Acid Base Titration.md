# Pre-Laboratory Lecture

## Objective

Determine concentration of unknown NaOH by [[Titration]]

$$\ce{ HCl_{aq} + NaOH_{aq} -> NaCl_{aq} + H_{2}O_{l} }$$

Concentration from bottle

# Set up

- Burette Clamp
- Iron Stand
- Burette
	- anything inside is the Titrant
	- Make sure nozzle is filled with titrant
	- Flush by opening stop cock 
- [[Titrants]]
	- NaOH
	- Determine the concentration of NaOH
- [[Indicators]]
- [[Analytes]]
	- Is 10 mL of HCL 
	- 20 mL Distilled Water
	- 2 - 3 Drops of [[Bromothymol Blue Indicators]]
	- Initially yellow 
- Continue to swirl flash until green indication
	- Mols is equal from NaOH Hcl
- Equivalence opoint: Moles of strong base = moles of acid
- Try placing white sheet of paper to improve observation

## Saftey and Technique

- Always wear safety goggles
- D onot contaminate
- Don't put personal pipet in stock container
- label transfer pipette

## Reading the Buret Meniscus at Eye level

- Read to 2 decimal places
- First two digit are exact
- Numbers decrease going upwards

## Data and Calculations

- Condition the buret with NaOh
- Conditioning the Volumetric pipet with HCl 
- Perform a rough titration run (trial 1)
	- Initial buret reading in mL
	- Final Buret Reading mL
- Volume of NaOH used is final reading - intial reading
- Performing accurate titration run a few times, about 2 - 3 more times
- Record data for each run
- [x] Watch video for lab âœ… 2023-10-10

# Treatment of Data

- Do not go beyond last mark 
- Calculate moles of HCl added using volume and molarity of HCl
	- Just 10 mL of HCl
	- mols of HCl = vol of HCl (L) * concentration of MCl (M)
- Calculate moles of NaOH present using reaction [[Stoichiometry]]
- $\ce{ HCl + NaOH -> NaCl + H_{2}O }$
- Mols of NaOH =  mol of HCl
- Molarity of NaOH = mol NaOH/Volume of NaOH used
