The traits that affect an organism's schedule of reproduction and survival make up [[Life History]]

Three key components include: When reproduction begins, how often they reproduce, and how many offspring are produced per episode.

[[Semelparity]] is one time or big-bang reproduction 
[[Iteroparity]] is repeated reproduction

# Trade-offs and Life Histories

Trade-offs occur because organisms do not have access to unlimited resources
Selective Pressures influence trade offs between number and size of offspring
Plants and animals with low survival produce a lot of off spring
Parents and offspring dynamics lead to less amounts of offspring
