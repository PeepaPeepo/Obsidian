# Determination of Unknown Organic Compounds by Melting Point Comparison

## Objective

Purpose of of experiment is to identify two unknown substances by comparing its melting points to other known melting points using a Vernier Melt Station. In this experiment Unknown Sample 2051's melting range will be measured to determine it's identity when cross referenced to known melting ranges. Unknown Sample 3104 will be identified by comparing its melting ranges to pure cinnamic acid, urea, and mixtures of itself mixed with the previously mentioned substances.

## Procedure

### Preparation

- Prepared Venier Melt Station 
- Obtained 7 capillary tubes
- Obtained ~5mg each of two unknown samples with scoopula for "Exercise C.2" and "Exercise C.3"
- Obtained ~5 mg of Cinnamic Acid and Urea and placed in separated medium watch glass for later use

### Exercise C.2 Melting Point of Unknown Solid

- Loaded two capillary tubes with unknown sample, 2051
- Set Venier Melt Station 180 C
- Placed 1/2 capillary tubes into melt station
- Monitored and recorded temperature from first sight of liquid and complete transition to liquid
- Reset and cooled Melt Station to 30 C
- Placed 2/2 capillary tubes into Melt Station and set setting to Rapid Heating
- Monitored temperature until 10 degrees within of expected melting temperature, set setting to temperature of expected melting point
- Recorded Results

### Exercise C.3: Mixed Melting Point

- Repeated previous protocol to measure melting points of Cinnamic Acid, Urea, and unknown sample, 3104
- Created mixture of 1 mg Cinnamic Acid + 1 mg Unknown Sample and loaded into a new capillary
- Created mixture of 1 mg Urea + 1 mg unknown Sample and loaded into a new capillary
- Measured melting points of the previous two mixtures

# Discussion and Conclusion

Unknown sample 2051 and 3104's melting range were observed and compared to other known melting points to determine its identities. As seen in Table 1, Unknown Sample 2051 has an approximate melting range of 152.5 - 154.5 ˚C which is within range of the melting range of Adipic Acid's melting point of 153 ˚C stated in lab protocol. Unknown sample 3104 is determined to be Urea; when comparing the two mixtures of "Cinnamic Acid + Unknown 3104" and "Urea + Unknown 3104" the melting range is broadened by almost 13˚C in "Cinnamic Acid + Unknown 3104" indicating the presence of impurities. "Urea + Unknown 3104" similar ranges to Urea B, and Pure Unknown 3104. Comparing known and unknown melting ranges can be used in identification of substances and measuring its purity. 

# Answers to Post-Lab Questions  

1. A student measures the melting point of Benzoic acid and reports the melting point in the lab notebook as 122 C. Explain what the student did wrong.

The recorded temperature does not indicate if it is the maximum or minimum temperature of the melting point range, although finalized recorded temperatures are typically maximum temperature of the range. This data in this scenario is ambiguous.

2. For what to purposes are melting points routinely used?

Determination of purity and identity of compounds are two purposes of implementing melting points.

3. What two effects do impurities have on the melting point of the compound

Impurities can sometimes form a eutectic mixture and achieve a sharp melting point, but in most cases impurities lower melting points and broaden the melting point range ~10 degrees C more or less.

4. If a sample melts 136-137 C, can you conclude that it is a pure compound? Explain why or why not.

It is unknown if that sample has that exact range, and it could also be a eutectic mixture that could cause the narrow melting range. Pure compounds can have various melting ranges, so it would be ambiguous without cross referencing. 

5. Benzoic acid and 2-naphthol each melt at 122 C. An unknown solid melts close to 122 C, so it is probably either benzoic acid or 2-naphthol. Describe a method to determine the identiy of the unknown compound.

Create two mixtures, Benzoic Acid + Unknown and 2-Napththol + Unknown, measure melting point ranges. If one mixture has the same melting ranges as one of the known that means the unknown is the same. If the unknown is different there would be a broadening of melting point range.
