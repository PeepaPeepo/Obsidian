# Organic Chemistry: What do I Smell?

Sweet smell of jasmine is [[Benzyl Acetate]]
Emitted from flower bind with \receptor in nose
Dead fish is Triethylamine
Vanillin
Cinnameldehyde

# Vitalism: The difference between orgnic and inorganic compounds **

Organic and Inorganic compounds
Organic compounds came from living things such as sugar
Inorganic Compounds came from earth
Salt 

# Difference between organic 

Different properties
Organic compounds break into C and H
Inorganic is more difficult to decompose
Organic hard to synthesize
Ino is not
Organic compounds are unique to living organisms
Thought to have a vital force
[[Vitalism]] was early belief to it was required for o compounds

# Laboratory Synthesis of Urea

Wohler heated ammonium cyanate and formed urea

# Origin of life

[[Stanley Miller]] and recreated enviornment of primordial earth 
Contained organic compounds especially [[Amino Acids]]
Creation in environment like earth
Ability to copy

# Carbon: A Versatile Atom

compounds containing carbon is greataer thant the numbers than the amount of elements
Carbon has four valence electrons
It can bond to itself to from cahin, branched, and ring structures

# Molecular Geometry

Four single bonds around a carbon predicts Tetrahedral geometryt
Double bond and two single bonds lead to trigonal planar
Triple bond and single bond leads to linear 
Carbon always has four bonds
IPG = MG when LP = 0

# Hydrocarbons

[[Hydrocarbons]] broadly make [[Alkanes]], [[Alkenes]], [[Alkynes]], and [[Aromatic Hydrocarbon]]
Alkanes are ssaturated with Hydrogen
Everyhing else is unsaturated
Based on number of hydrogen

Alkane $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n+2} }$ have single bonds
Alkene $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n} }$ Double bonds 
Alkyne $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n-2} }$ Triple bonds

Suffix words -ane, -ene, and -yne

# Alkanes: Saturated Hydrocarbons

Simples alkane is methane
Structural formula is liek a lewis structure but it typically depicts electron pairs as dashes and omits lone pairs
Ethane is a minority component of natural gas
[[Condensed Structural Formula]] is a shorthand for writing structural formula in which elimate many or all bonds and group like atoms together
$\ce{ CH_{3}(CH_{2})_{m}CH_{3} }$

Naming schemes 

Number of carbon name + Hydrogen count

1 carbon = Meth
2 C = Eth
3 C = Prop
4 C = But
5 C = Pen
6 C = Hex
8 C = Oct
Sept
Deca

Suffix based on hydrocarbon

-Ane
-ene
-ynes

# Naming Alkanes

Prefix is determined by number carbon atoms in [[Base Chain]] (the longest chain of continuous atoms)

# Saturated Hydrocarbons

As number of carbon atoms increase in n alkanes, so does boiling point
ale alkanes are gases at room temp
Pentane is liquid at room temp

# Alkanes: Branched Alkanes

No branching straight chain is called [[Normal Alkanes]] or [[Normal Alkanes|n-alkanes]]
Branched sturtures such as Isobutane
$\ce{ C_{4}H_{10} }$ is butane as a straight chain or branch
	Can also be Isobutane due to branching

# Naming Alkanes

Groups of carbons branched off the base chain are called [[Alkyl Groups]]
[[Substituents]] are atom or groups that have been substituted for hydrogen atom in an organic compound
[[Isomers]] is same formula different shape
[[IUPAC]]  basename of organic compound consists of prefix and an eding

# The Rules to Systematically name alkanes

1. Count longest continuous carbon chain  to determine base name
2. Consider every branch from base chain to be substituent 
3. Begin with end closes to branching number of number of carbon atoms in the base, if equidistant, look at second branch
4. substituent number, substituent name, and base name
5. List them alphabetically with hyphens

Base name from hydrocarbon
Methyl groups at 2 and 4 carbon

## Alkenes and Alkynes

Alkenes contain at least one double bond
Alkynes contain at least one triple bonds
Both are unsaturated
Alkenes have formula $\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n-2} }$

## Ethene is also called Ethylene

Simples alkene is ethene
Acts as chemical messenger, inducing bananas to ripe
Banana farm ship green
Bananas are gassed with ethene to ripen

## Ethyne is also called acetylene

simplest alkyne is ethyne, or acetylene
Each is linear
$\ce{ C_{n}H_{2n-2} }$


Base chaine is numbered to give the doulbe or triple bond to the lowest possilbe number

## Hydrocarbon Reacions

[[Combustion Reactions]] is hte burning of hydrocarbons in the presences of oxygen
Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes all undergo combustion
Fomration of CO2 and H2O
Hydrocarbon combustion reactions are hihgly exothermic
[[Alkane Substitution Reactions]] one or more hydrogen atoms on an alkane are replaced by one or more other types of atoms
[[Halogen Substitutions]]
Methane reacted with Chlorine gas to form chloromethane
[[Hydrogenation Reactions]] convert unsaturated hydrocarbons into saturated hydrocarbons
oil is unsaturated
Carbon chains contain pi bonds
Unsat fats tend to be liquids at room temp
Hydrogen is added across double bonds confering unsat fat into partially hydrogenated vegetable oil
Tends to be solid

Summary

Hydrocarbons undergo combustion reactions
ALkanes undergo substitution reactions
alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions

## Aromatic Hydrocarbons

[[Benzene]] 
Bond lengths are all the same length
Aromatic Compounds
Structures of benzenes are easily represented by resonance structures

## Naming Aromatic Hydrocarbons

[[Monosubstituted Benzenes]] only have one hydrogen atom substituted and often name call derivative

## Disubstituted Benzenes

[[Disubstituted Benzenes]] have two hydrogen atoms have been substitutde
	Numbered and the substituents are listed alphabetically
	Order of numbering within ring the determined by alphabetical order of the substituents
	When two substituents are identical, prefixes can be used such as di and tri

 1, 2 Dichlorobenzene 

# Functional Groups

[[Functional Gxroups]] are cahracteristic atom or group of atoms that is inserted into [[Hydrocarbons]]
R is used to represent hydrocarbon group
G is the functional group,
$\ce{ R - G }$

[[Hydroxyl Groups]] makes alchohol
[[Carbonyl Groups]] makes [[Aldehydes]] or [[Ketones]]
[[Amino Group]] makes [[Amines]]
[[Methyl Group]] make [[Methylated Compound]]
[[Carboxyl Groups]] makes [[Carboxylic Acid]]
