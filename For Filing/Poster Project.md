# Introduction

## DNA Isolation

Extraction and purifcation of [[Genomes|Genomic]] [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]], use of [[Buffers]], [[Spin Columns]], and [[Cells]]. Purity of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] is measured through [[Spectrophotometry]] on [[NanoDrop 2000]], 260/280 Ratio of 1.8 is extremely pure DNA.

## Polymerase Chain Reaction

Technique to amplify small amounts of DNA to generate larger amounts. It copies specific DNA regions. It is framed using Forward and Reverse Primers. DNA Sample is the [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Templates|DNA Templates]] 
It goes through thermo cycler to promote polymerization
Template DNA has genomes or Nuclear DNA. It exists 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes.
One chromosome is from a parent
They are made up of one DNA Helix around histones
Protein coding genes are particular portion of DNA Seq
Altnerative forms of a Gene are called variations or Gene Variants called [[Alleles]]. 
[[Genotypes]] of any gene relate to a set of two allels. They exist at [[Loci]] where gene resides on a chromosome. Set of alleles are determined by heredity and mutation.

Project is Screening for Genotypes, lactose intolrance, caffein etc

## Agarose Gel Electrophoresis

Separates DNA based on size
Two bands a sample indicates Heterozygous Genotype
Confirms PCR Efficacy, DNA Sequencing is needed to fully understand

# Materials and Methods

## Part 1A: DNA Isolation and Purification Protocol via Saliva

Acquired 1.7 mL Posi-Click Tube by Denville and filled with ~1.5 mL of saliva after scraping tongue between molars. Transferred the microcentrifuge tube to centrifuge and processed it at 3.0 x g for 5 minutes on Fisher Scientific accuSpin Micro 17.

Using a p1000 discarded supernatant while avoiding the cell pellet. Added 200 uL of PBS, 20 uL of Proteinase K and vortexed for 15 seconds.

Using a p1000 added 200 uL of Buffer AL and vortexed for 15 seconds.

Placed 1.7 mL tube in heat block at 56 $\ce{ ^oC }$ for 10 minutes. Centrifuged sample at 3,000 g for 1 minute.

Added 200 uL of Ethanol EtOH and vortexted for 15 second

Transferred 500 ul of lysate centrifuged for 3.0 at 1 minute

added remaining centrifuged for 3.0 at 2 minutes

lysate still remained centrifuged for 3.0 at 1 minute

Added 500 ul AW1 buffer, centrifuged at 6.0 g for 1 minute
Still had excess Centrifuged at 6.0 g for 1 minute

Added 500 uL of AW2 Buffer, Centrifuged at 17,000 g for 3 minutes, dumped flow through liquid

Acquired new 1.7 posi-click tube and transferred spin column to it, added 200 uL buffer AE and incubated for atleast 1 minute. Centrifuged for 6,000 g at 1 minute.

labelled as PC pure DNA 

## Part 1B: DNA Concentration Quantification via NanoDop Spectrophotometry

On NanoDrop 2000 cleaned with Kimwipes and blanked with 2 uL AE Buffer, cleaned again with Kimwipe and named sample ID ...canuto. Loaded 2 uL of purified DNA and documented with smart phone

## Part 2: Preparation of PCR Samples and Polymerase Chain Reaction

Acquired 4 PCR tubes labelled as PC Lac, Dia, Sei, Caf
Added 10 uL 2xPCR Master mix to each
Added 5 uL of Pure DNA
added 2 uL of Appropriate Primers for each

Added all to PCR in to thermocycler all same settings

Poured gel solution in casting tray.

Created MWM solution with 5 ul of MWM, 2 uL of Loading Dye, and 3 ul of 1X TAE.
Created Solution with 5 ul of Loading dye, and 5 ul of each PCR Sample in this order: Lac Dia Sieze Caf

## Part 4: ExoSap

Added 1 ul of each sample (Lac Dia Seize Caf) to ready made 4 ul ExoSap Mix (1 il Exo Sap + 3 ul ultra pure water).

Thermocylced at the following settings

| function          | Temperature | Time | Cycles |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---- | ------ |
| First incubation  | 37 C        | 30m  | 1      |
| Second Incubation | 80 C        | 15m  | 1      |

## Part 5: Cycle Sequencing

Processed by another instructor. Added 5 uL ExoSap Product, 4 uL BigDye 3.1, 1 uL forward primer.

Cycle sequecned at the following settings.

## Background


## Introduction

Caffeine is commonly used across America, estimating that ~85% of the population consumes at least one caffeinated beverage a day. 

Mitchell DC, Knight CA, Hockenberry J, Teplansky R, Hartman TJ. Beverage caffeine intakes in the U.S. Food Chem Toxicol. 2014 Jan;63:136-42. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2013.10.042. Epub 2013 Nov 1. PMID: 24189158.


### Purpose or Objective

Purpose of this experiment is to screen DNA to find if an specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect coding of [[Adenosine A2a Receptor]] understand its relation caffeine sensitivity.

### Description of Diseases

Reports show that caffeine sensitivity is correlated to rs5751876 SNP T>C genotype, with data that show more complaints of insomnia with the genotype C/C.

==This gene encodes a member of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which is subdivided into classes and subtypes.== The receptors are seven-pass transmembrane proteins that respond to extracellular cues and activate intracellular signal transduction pathways. ==This protein, an adenosine receptor of A2A subtype, uses adenosine as the preferred endogenous agonist and preferentially interacts with the G(s) and G(olf) family of G proteins to increase intracellular cAMP levels.== It plays an important role in many biological functions, such as cardiac rhythm and circulation, cerebral and renal blood flow, immune function, pain regulation, and sleep. It has been implicated in pathophysiological conditions such as inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. A read-through transcript composed of the upstream SPECC1L (sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1-like) and ADORA2A (adenosine A2a receptor) gene sequence has been identified, but it is thought to be non-coding.
