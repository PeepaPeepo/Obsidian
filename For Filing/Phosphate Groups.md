$$\ce{ -OPO_{3}^- }$$

- [[Functional Groups]] that contains a [[Phosphorus]] bonded to four [[Oxygen|oxygens]], where one of the bonds is a [[Double Covalent Bonds|double bond]]. Two of the tail end oxygens are negatively charged
- When in a chain of phosphates it has one negative charge, but two when its at the end of a chain
- Compounds containing the functional group are called [[Organic Phosphate]]
- A chain of three [[Phosphate Groups]] can link to [[Pentoses]] such as [[Ribose]] and [[Deoxyribose]]
	- Starting from the phosphate connected to the [[Pentoses]], each pentose is called $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ phosphate
