[[Transcription Factors]]  are a set of [[Proteins]] that guide the [[Initiation]] of [[Transcription]] and binding of of [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]]. It is the first set of [[Proteins]] that bind onto [[Promoters]] of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]], and it enables the binding of [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II]].

The formation created when [[Transcription Factors]], [[Promoters]], and [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerase II]] join is called hte [[Transcription Initiation Complex]] 

[[Transcription Factors]] can be classified by [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid Binding Domains|DNA-Binding Domains]]

[[General Transcription Factors]]
