- Requires addition of more reagents of newly created PCR Sample
- [[Buffers]] and [[Enzymatic Proteins]] must be added to PCR sample before [[Thermocycling]]
- Restriction enzyme will cut DNA at a specific [[Single Nucleotide Polymorphism]], also known as [[Single Nucleotide Polymorphism|SNP]], location
- Restriction enzyme digestions are required for some genotypes but not others
- During [[Agarose Gel Electrophoresis]] there will be two small fragments if variation SNP is present
- Two fragments correlate with the cutting of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]
- A [[Homozygous]] [[Genotypes]] 
	- The same allele between parents
- One single fragment correlates with lack of cutting
	- Still a homzygous genotype
- Observation of one gragment and two fragments is linked to a hterozygous genotype
	- Different genotype between parents
- For majority of genotypes, eleectrophoresis is not the final step
	- It is a confirmation test of pcr efficacy
	- Some genotypes may require resiriction enyzme digest
	- Some need DNA fingerprinting or DNA sequencing
