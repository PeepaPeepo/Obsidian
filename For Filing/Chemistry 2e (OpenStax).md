# 6: Electronic Structure and Periodic Properties

## 6.1: Electromagnetic Energy

### Learning Objective



# 7: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry



## 7.0: Introduction

[[Buckminsterfullerene Molecules]] 

## 7.1: Ionic Bonding

[[Cations]] form when neutral [[Atoms]] loses one or more [[Electrons]] from its [[Valence Shells]]
[[Anions]] form when neutral [[Atoms]] gain one or more [[Electrons]] from its [[Valence Shells]]
[[Ionic Compounds]] form [[Ionic Compounds|Salts]] and are composed of [[Cations]] and [[Anions]]; [[Metals]] and [[Nonmetals]]
They are [[Crystalline]] and tend to be rigid and brittle
[[Ionic Compounds|Salts]] are readily soluble in water
[[Ionic Compounds|Salts]] are [[Conduction|Conductive]] when melted or dissolved

### The Formation of Ionic Compounds

[[Binary Ionic Compounds]] consists of [[Metals]] and [[Nonmetals]]
[[Metals]] have lower [[Ionization]]
[[Nonmetals]] have higher
All [[Substances]] must be electrically neutral
[[Ionic Compounds]] do no represent the physical arrangement of its ion
Attract forces between ions are [[Isotropic]] same in all directions

It takes energy to break the ionic bond between sodium and clorine

$\ce{ NaCl(s) -> Na+ (g) + Cl- (g) \Delta H = 769 kJ }$

### Electronic Structures of Cations

[[Alkali Metals|Group 1 Elements]] and [[Alkaline Earth Metals|Group 2 Elements]] tend to lose their valence electrons to obtain a stable electron configuration.

Groups 13-17, the group numbers exceed the number of valence electrons by 10.
The charge of a cation formed by the loss of all valence electrons is equal to the group number minus 10.

$\ce{ Al = 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^1 }$

Inert pair effect which reflects the relatively low energy of valence s- electron pair for heavy elements of 13, 14, 15

[[Transition Elements|Transition Metals]] behave differently
Most transition metal cations have 2+ or 3+ from the loss of valence s electrons, then one or tow d electrons

Chromium $\ce{ Cr = 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^4}$
Zinc $\ce{ Zn = 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^10 }$

Transition metals lose electrons starting at the highest energy level, although fills up in a different order. Transition metals also lose from their highest s orbital then following the next d orbital

For row 4, the 3d block is loaded up along with the 4 orbitals

### Electronic Structures of Anions

[[Monatomic Anions]] form when neutral nonmetals gain enough electrons to form a noble gas configuration

$\ce{ I- = [Kr] 5s^2 4d^10 5p^6 }$
$\ce{ Se^2- = [Ar] 3d^10 4s^2 4p^6 }$

### Exercise 7.1.2

Write the electron configurations of a phosphorus atom and its negative ion. Give the charge on the anion.

$\ce{ P = [Ne] 3s^2 3p^3 }$
$\ce{ P^3- = [Ne] 3s^2 3p^6 }$

## 7.2: Covalent Bonding

### Learning Objectives

- Describe formation of [[Covalent Bonds]]
- Define [[Electronegativity]] and assess [[Polarity]] of [[Covalent Bonds]]

Covalent bonds generally have much lower melting and boiling points than ionic compounds
Many covalent bonds are liquids or gases at room temp
Most covalent compounds are insoluble in water
The neutral charge doesn't lend to any conduction

### Formation of Covalent Bonds

Nonmetals that share electrons with other nonmetals can form covalent bonds
Energy must be added to break chemical bonds endothermically
Forming bonds is an exothermic process

### Pure vs Polar Covalent Bonds

Pure bonds share electrons equally between atoms
[[Diatomic Elements]] form pure covalent bonds because they are two of the same kind of atoms with equal [[Electronegativity]]

$\ce{ Cl + Cl -> Cl_{2} }$ 

This Diatomic element has six [[Nonbonding Electrons]] and two [[Bonding Electrons]]
This also matches the number of valence electrons in the Argon Configuration

[[Polar Covalent Bonds]] have unequal sharing of electrons between two different atoms and it forms partial negative and positive charges
The atom that attracts the electrons more have a partial negative charge
Positive and Negative atoms can be notated with delta+/delta- , $\ce{ \delta+/\delta- }$

### Electronegativity

[[Electronegativity]] is a measure of the tendency of an atom to pull electrons
The greater difference of [[Electronegativity]] forms greater Partial Charges
[[Elements]] on the top right of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]] have the highest [[Electronegativity]], and bottom left has the lowest

### Electronegativity versus Electron Affinity

[[Electron Affinity]] of an element is the energy released or absorbed when one gas atom acquires one electron and measured in kJ/mol

### Electronegativity and Bond Type

The [[Absolute Value]] of the difference of [[Electronegativity]] $\ce{ \Delta EN }$ can provide an estimated amount of polarity and its type

The Three types include [[Nonpolar Covalent Bond|Pure Covalent Bonds]], [[Polar Covalent Bonds]], and [[Ionic Bonds]]

| bond type      | Electronegativity Difference |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Pure Covalent  | < 0.4                        |
| Polar Covalent | 0.4 - 1.8                    |
| Ionic          |          > 1.8                    |

There are exceptions such as $\ce{ HF }$ and $\ce{ NH_{3} }$ which are still polar covalent 
$\ce{ Na }$ and $\ce{ Cl }$ are ionic

Its helpful to refer to the nonmetal + nonmetal and metal + nonmetal rules

Some compounds can contain covalent and ionic bonds like $\ce{ KNO_{3} }$

### Example 7.2.17.2.1: Electronegativity and Bond Polarity

Bond polarities play an important role in determining the structure of proteins. Using the electronegativity values in Figure  7.2.3
 , arrange the following covalent bonds—all commonly found in amino acids—in order of increasing polarity. Then designate the positive and negative atoms using the symbols δ+ and δ–:

$$\ce{ C–H, C–N, C–O, N–H, O–H, S–H } $$
$\ce{ C-H = 0.4 }$ Polar
$\ce{ C - N = 0.5 }$ Polar
$\ce{ C - O = 1 }$ Polar
$\ce{ N - H = 0.9 }$ Polar
$\ce{ O - H = 1.4 }$ Polar
$\ce{ S - H = 0.4 }$ Polar

## 7.3: Lewis Symbols and Structures

### Learning Objectives

Draw lewis structures depicting the bonding in simple molecules

### Lewis Symbols

[[Lewis Symbols]] are used to interpret [[Valence Electrons]] configurations of atoms and [[Monatomic Ions]]. Dots represent each of its valence electrons

$$\ce{ *Ca* } $$
Lewis symbols can illustrate ions

### Lewis Structures

Refer to Notebook 2023, 233 for hand written notes

## Forces between Molecules

[[Intramolecular Forces]] are within molecules that keep the [[Molecules]] together such as the covalent or ionic bonds

You can break [[Intramolecular Forces]] and [[Intermolecular Forces]] molecule to molecule and atom to atom with enough [[Kinetic Energy]]

## Dispersion Forces

[[London Dispersion Forces]] are one of three [[Van der Waals Interactions|Van der Waals Forces]] which exist in all condensed [[States of Matter]] 

At any time an atom or molecule can develope temporary [[Instantaneous Dipole]] if there is a [[Polarity]] within a molecule

[[Instantaneous Dipole]] can distort electrons of neighboring [[Atoms]] or [[Molecules]] forming an [[Induced Dipole]]

[[London Dispersion Forces|Dispersion Forces]] that develop between atoms in molecules can attaract the molecules like hyrdogen bonding

Heavier molecules and atoms can form stronger dispersion forces

The dispersion forces can affect phase change points because of the strength of the dispersion forces

# 10: Intermolecular Forces

- Types of [[Intermolecular Forces]] between [[Atoms]] or [[Molecules]] in condensed Phases
- [[London Dispersion Forces]], [[Dipole Moments]], and [[Hydrogen Bonds]]
[[Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases|Kinetic Molecular Theory]] can be used to explain behavior of [[Solids]] and [[Liquids]]
[[Particles]] refer to [[Atoms]], [[Molecules]], or [[Ions]]
[[Intermolecular Forces]] or [[Intermolecular Forces|Intermolecular Interactions]] refer to attractive foreces between particles

[[States of Matter]] depends on [[Intermolecular Forces]] and [[Kinetic Energy]] of its [[Molecules]]

Particles [[Kinetic Energy]] provides the energy required to overcome the [[Intermolecular Forces]]

# 17: Electrochemistry

## 17.2 Galvanic Cells

[[Electrochemical Cells]] that cause a flow of electrons
[[Galvanic Cells]] are also called [[Voltaic Cells]]
	Where [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] [[Chemical Reactions]] can occur
	Compromised of [[Redox Conjugate Pairs]]
		Cu and Cu (II)
		Ag (I) and Ag
[[Electrodes]] can be either [[Anodes]] or [[Cathodes]]
	[[Anodes]] are where [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] takes place
	[[Cathodes]] are were [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Reduction]] takes place

## 17.3 Electrode and Cell Potentials

[[Potentials]] are measured in the volt unit as one joule of energy per coulomb of charge

$$\ce{ V = \frac{J}{C} }$$
Commonly called [[Voltage]]
Potential of a single half cell cannot be measured without a transfer of electrons
Half cell potential may only be assess relative to that of another half cell
[[Cell Potentials]] is only the difference in [[Potentials]] between two half cells

$\ce{ E_{cell} = E_{cathode} - E_{anode} }$

[[Standard Cell Potential]] uses standard states as variables

[[Standard Hydrogen Electrode]] (SHE) is used to create a standardized set of [[Cell Potentials]] based on the following [[Half-Reactions]]

$\ce{ 2 H+ (aq) + 2e- -> H_{2}(g) }$

[[Standard Hydrogen Electrode]] contains inert platinum electrode immersed in 1 M H+ and a stream of $\ce{ H_{2} }$ at one pressure at 298K

Using SHE, the formation of [[Standard Reduction Potentials]] have been created

### Interpreting Electrode and Cell Potentials

Positive [[Cell Potentials]] create [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] reactions
Negative [[Cell Potentials]] create [[Spontaneity|Nonspontaneous]] reactions
[[Standard Reduction Potentials]] sorts from Strongest [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidant]] to weakest oxidant (most negative potential)

## 17.4 Potential, Free Energy, and Equilibrium

Relationship between cell potential and spontaneity suggests a relationship to [[Gibbs Free Energy Change|Free Energy]]

### $\ce{ E^o }$ and $\ce{ \Delta G^o }$

Standard [[Gibbs Free Energy Change|Free Energy]] is the maximum work that could be performed by a system, $w_{max}$.

$$\ce{ \Delta G^o = w_{max} = w_{elec} }$$
$$\ce{ w_{elec} = -nFE^o _{cell} }$$

$\ce{ n }$ = number of mole of electrons transferred
$\ce{ F }$ = [[Faraday's Constant]]
$\ce{ E^o _{cell} }$  = [[Standard Cell Potential]]

### $\ce{ E^o }$ and $\ce{ K }$

$\ce{ \Delta G^o = -RT \ln K = -nFE^o _{cell} }$
$\ce{ E^o _{coll} = \left( \frac{RT}{nF} \right) \ln K }$

### Potentials at Nonstandard Conditions: The Nernst Equation

$\ce{ \Delta G = \Delta G^o + RT \ln Q }$

[[Nernst Equation]]

$\ce{ E_{cell} = E^o _{cell} - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q }$
