# Concept 22.1 The Darwinian Revolution challenged traditional views of a young earth inhabited by unchanging species

## Endless forms Most Beautiful

[[Organisms]] adapt for life in their [[Environments]]
[[Evolution]] is descent with modification phrased by [[Charles Darwin]] or the change in genetic composition of a population from [[Generation]] to generation
[[Species]] accumulate differences from their ancestors as they adapt to different environments

## Scala Naturae and Classification of Species 

[[Scala Naturae]] is an concept by [[Aristotle]] that states life can be organized by complexity, it translates to Scale of Nature

[[Carolus Linnaeus]] developed the [[Binomial]] format for naming species
Nested classification system, groups similar species and [[Genus]] or [[Genus|Genera]]

## Ideas About Change over Time

[[Fossils]] are remains or traces of [[Organisms]]
[[Strata]] or [[Strata|Stratum]] are compressed layers of rock and each layer can be connected to older periods of time as the deeper it goes
[[Paleontology]] is the study of fossils developed by [[Georges Cuvier]]

## Lamarck's Hypothesis of Evolution

# 2024-01-24 Lecture

## Timeline

[[Malthus]] "Essay on the Principle of Population"
[[The Origin]] by [[Charles Darwin]]
1866 - [[Mendel]]'s book about genetics

Memories [[Mendel]] and 

## What causes variations amongst species

Descent is shared ancestry, resulting with shared characteristics
Modification is the accumulation of differences

## Endless forms most beautiful

[[Unity of Life]]
[[Diversity of Life]]
[[Adaptations]] to biotic and abiotic environment
[[Species]] - [[Organisms]] that can reproduce successfully
[[Species]] can be within the same [[Genus]]
[[Evolution]] is the process where species accumulate differences to different enviornments over time 


Genetic Variation caused by the following:

[[Theory of Natural Selection]]
[[Bottleneck Effect]]
[[Genetic Drift]]
[[Mutations]]
[[Migration]]
[[Nonrandom Mating]]

## Scala Naturae and Classification of Species 

[[Aristotle]] arranged species on a scale of increasing complexity called [[Scala Naturae]] 
[[James Hutton]] proposed earth was gradually made
[[Charles Lyell]] proposed same geologic processes operate today like the past
[[Charles Darwin]]

## Lamarck's Hypothesis of Evolution

[[Jean-Baptiste de Lamark]]
[[Use and Disuse]] body parts used extensively becomes stronger, non used will deteriorate
[[Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics]], organisms can pass modification to offspring

## Concept Descent with modificaiton by nautral selction explains the adaptaions of organisms and the unity and diversity of life

[[Charles Darwin]]

## The Voyage of the Beagle

Collection of species of south American plants and animals
Inferred that earthquakes showed different strata 

## Galapagos Islands Overview

## Darwin's Focus on Adaptation

[[Adaptations]] are inherited characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction i
Gradual accumulation of adaptations
Finches have different functional parts

## Natural Selection

[[Theory of Natural Selection]] is a process with certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates
[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] proposed a similar hypothesis

Three broad observation

[[Unity of Life]]
	Common ancestor
[[Diversity of Life]]
	Non identical
Organisms are suited for their environment

Trees of life based on [[Morphology]] or [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and its specific markers

## Artificial Selection, Natural Selection, and Adaptation

Humans modifiy speciceis 
Crops such as wild mustards change into brussels kohlrabi, broccoli

Members of a population often vary in trait
All species can produce more offspring than the environment can support and many offspring fail to survive and reproduce

Inference that individuals with inherited traits increase survival and reproduction

Unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce will lead to accumulation of favorable traits in population

[[Thomas Malthus]]

Offspring complete development and reproduce the rest are starved or eliminated 

## Key features of natural selection

Higher reproduction
INcrease frequency of adaptation in that environment
Change in environment may result in change of natural selection
[[Populations]] evolve over time
Natural selection can increase or decrease [[Heritable Traits]] that ar variable

## Evolution of Drug Resistant Bacteria

[[Staphylococus Auerus]] 
can mutate into different species like any other
[[Bacteria]] have circular [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]]
[[Penicillin]]
[[Methicillin]] resistance evolved
Resistance is spreading faster than new discovvery of antibioitcs

[[Teixobactin]]

## Key Point 

[[Theory of Natural Selection]] doesn't create new traigts, but only selects
[[Bacteria]] geenration in a few minutes
Humans are about 30 years
Selection of advantageous

## Homology

Similarities from common ancestry
[[Homology]]

Homolgous strctures are anatomically simialr
Comparative embryology reveals anatomical homolgies not visible in adult organisms
[[Post-Anal Tails]]

Molecular Homolgies

[[Pseudogenes]] exist but do not function

[[Evolutionary Trees]]

## A different cause of resemblance

[[Convergent Evolution]] but [[Analogy]]

# Concept 22.2 Descent with modification by natural selection explains the adaptations of organisms and the unity and diversity of life 

## Darwin's Research

[[Charles Darwin]] from Shrewsbury, Western England
Survey ship HMS Beagle

## The Voyage of the Beagle

Voyage began 1831
Chart Stretches of south American coast
Collected plants and Animals
Organisms were well suited to diverse environments
Similarities were found with near regions vs europe
[[Lyell's Principles of Geology]] 
Found fossils at higher altitudes
[[Galapagos]] are a group of volcanic islands with similar but different birds

## Darwin's Focus on Adaptations

[[Adaptations]] is an inherited characteristic of organisms that enhance their survival and reproduction in specific environments
Finches adapted their beaks to their food
[[Theory of Natural Selection]] is the process in which individuals that have certain inherited traits tend to survive and reproduce at higher rates because of the traits

## Ideas from The Origin of Species

### Descent with Modification

Descent is shared ancestry resulting in shared characteristics
Modification as the accumulation of differences

### Artificial Selection, Natural Selection, and Adaptation

[[Artificial Selection]] is the selection of specific individuals for breeding for desired traits such as crops, live stock, and pets

## Key Features of Natural Selection

[[Theory of Natural Selection|Natural Selection]] is the process were individuals that have certain traits succeed at life
It can increase frequency of adaptations over given time
If environment changes, natural selection may result in adaptation to new environment
[[Individuals]] do not evolve, but the [[Populations]]
Amplify or diminish heritable traits
Environmental factors

# Concept 22.3 Evolution is supported by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence

Four types of data for evolution
Direct [[Observations]]
[[Homology]]
[[Fossils]]
[[Biogeography]]

## Direct Observations of Evolutionary Change

### Natural Selection in Response to Introduced Species

Soapberry Bugs and their adaptation to Balloon Vine

### Homology

[[Homology]] Related species can have characteristics that have an underlying similarity yet function differently

### Anatomical and Molecular Homologies

Mammals have similar arrangements of bones
[[Homologous Structures]] represent variation on structural theme that was present in their common ancestors

[[Vestigial Structures]] are remnants of features that functioned in ancestors
All forms of life use DNA, and thought to originate from a common ancestor

## Homologies and Tree Thinking

[[Tetrapoda]] vertebrate group that consists of amphibians, mammals, and reptiles
Homologous characteristics form a nested pattern
All lfe share the deepest layer, and each smaller group adds its own homolgoies
[[Evolutionary Trees]]

## A Different Cause of Resemblance: Convergent Evolution

[[Convergent Evolution]] is the independent evolution of similar features in different lineages
[[Analogy]] Sharing features that resemble each other

## The Fossil Record

## Biogeography

[[Biogeography]] is the scientific study of geographic distributions of species 
Influenced by continental drift
[[Pangaea]]
