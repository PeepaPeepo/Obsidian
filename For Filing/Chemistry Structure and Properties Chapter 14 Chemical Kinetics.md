# Catching Lizards and Ectotherms

[[Ectothermic|Ectotherms]] are animals whose body temperature matches their [[Environments]]
Lowered temperature results in lethargy in some animals
[[Chemical Kinetics]] is the study of the factors that affect the [[Rate of Chemical Reactions]] such as [[Temperature]]

# Chemical Kinetics

Speed of Chemical Reactions are called [[Reaction Rates]]
The rate of the reaction is a measure of how fast the reaction makes [[Products]] or use [[Reactants]]
Controlling speeds of reactions must be accounted for

# Factors affecting reaction rate: reactant concentration

Higher concentration of [[Reactants]] lead to faster rates
	Increased molecule contact
	Concentration of gases depend on [[Partial Pressure]] of [[Gases]]
		higher pressure leads to higher [[Concentrations]]
Concentrations of solutions depend on solute to solution ratios

# Factors Affecting Reaction Rate: Temperature

Increasing [[Temperature]] increases the reaction rate for most reactions
	Generally doubles every 10 degrees C
[[Svante Arrhenius]] and their [[Arrhenius Theory]]

# Factors Affecting Reaction Rate: Nature of the Reactants

Smaller molecules react faster
Greater entropy of substance, gases react faster than liquids and solids
Powdered solids are more reactive than blocks due to surface area
Some chemicals are more reactive than others
	Potassium more reactive than Sodium
	[[Table 16.1 Activity Series of Metals.png]]
Ions react faster than molecules
	no bonds need to be broken

# Defining Rate

[[Rate]] is how much a quantity changes in a given period of time
Such that mi/hr is a rate
change of qt/time

# Defining Reaction Rate

[[Rate of Chemical Reactions]] is measured in how much the concentration of a reactant decreases in a given period of time
Reactants can be the following 

$$\ce{ rate = - \frac{\Delta[I_{2}]}{\Delta t} }$$

# Reactant and Product Concentrations as a Function of Time

Rate of reaction slows over time because the concentration decrease

# Average Rate versus Instantaneous Rate

[[Average Rate]] is teh changed in measured concentrations in any time period
[[Instantaneous Rate]] is the change in concentration at any one particular time

# Reaction Rate and Stoichiometry

# Measuring Reaction Rate

Need to measure at least one component in the mixture at many points in time
	For reactions that are complete within an hour, use continuous monitoring
	Longer ones, sample at various times

# Continuous Monitoring

[[Total Pressure]] ptot of a gas mixutre is stoichiometrically related to [[Partial Pressure]] of the [[Gases]]
[[Polarimetry]] measures the changes in degree of rotation of plane polarized light caused by one of the components over time
[[Spectrophotometry]] measures amount of light absorbed by one component
	component absorbs complementary color

# Sampling the Reactions Mixture at Specific Times

[[Aliquots]], samples from reaction mixture, are drawn off at speicfic times
	titration for one component 
	Gravimetric Analysis
[[Gas Chromatography]] can measure the concentrations of various components in a mixture

# Finding the Rate Law: The Initial Rate Method

[[Rate Laws]] are determined experimentally **only**
