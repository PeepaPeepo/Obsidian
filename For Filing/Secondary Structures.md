[[Secondary Structures]] are the interactions between [[Amino Acids]] of [[Primary Structures]] of [[Proteins]]. Because of the consistent [[Polypeptide Backbones]] and varying [[Side Chains]], the [[Polypeptides]] can fold and coil into [[Alpha Helices]] and [[Beta Pleated Sheets]]. 

The repeating constituents of the backbone form [[Hydrogen Bonds]] when within range of each other.
