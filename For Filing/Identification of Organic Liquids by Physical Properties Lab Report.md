# Identification of Organic Liquids by Physical Properties Lab Report

## Objective

Purpose of experiment is to identify unknown liquid by comparing its boiling point and refractive index to physical properties of known liquids.

**Figure 2:** Line structure of Ethanol

# Procedure

## Part A: Boiling Point Determination

- Transferred 3 mL of unknown liquid, 624, to 5 mL conical vial
- Connected two orange liquid tubing to condenser and water outlet; flushed for 10 seconds
- Assembled micro-scale distillation apparatus with 5 mL conical vial, Hickman still, condenser, spin vane, heat block, two micro clamps, plate stand, hot plate, and thermometer
- Recorded ambient pressure based on room's barometer 
- Turned on temperature and stirring on hot plate and monitored unknown sample
- Started recorded temperature at first instance of condensation forming in Hickman still
- Stopped final recording when temperature was stable for 1 minute

## Part B: Refractive Index Determination

- Calibrated Abbe refractometer with EtOH
- Placed two drops of distilled unknown liquid via syringe
- Recorded refraction index

# Data

This section include lab's atmospheric pressure based on room's barometer, thermometer correction factor using boiling tap water as reference, and ABBE-3L correction factor using EthOH to calibrate. Recorded readings for boiling point apparatus and refractive index are listed in tables.

**Lab's Atmospheric Pressure:** 779.1 mmHG
**Thermometer Correction Factor:** +3˚C
**ABBE-3L Correction Factor:** -0.0009

| Sample | Trial | Minimum Boiling Point (˚C) | Maximum Boiling Point (˚C) |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 624    | 1     | 60.0                       | 62.0                       |
**Table 1:** Distillation results including sample name and minimum/maximum boiling points without apply a correction factor of +3˚C

| Sample  | Refractive Index (nD) |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| Ethanol | 1.3619                |
| 624     | 1.3749                |
**Table 2:** Refraction Index (nD) of Ethanol and 624 without applied correction factor of -0.0009 nD
# Calculations

## Thermometer Correction Factor

Thermometer Correction Factor = 100˚C - 97.0˚C
Thermometer Correction Factor = +3˚C

## ABBE-3L Correction Factor

EtOH Literature value = 1.3610
EtOH Measured value = 1.3619

ABBE-3L Correction Factor = 1.3610 - 1.3619 
ABBE-3L Correction Factor = -0.0009

# Discussion and Conclusion

Based on the data recored in **Table 1** and **Table 2**, sample 624 has an estimated boiling point and refractive index of 63.0-65.0˚C and 1.3740 nD after applying the Thermometer and ABBE-3L Correction factors appropriately. When cross referencing with the literature values provided in the protocol sample 624 has a similar boiling point as 3-Methylpentane (63.3˚C). The refractive index is not as close to the literature value (1.3765 nD), the measured and corrected value of 624's refractive index 1.3740 nD is technically closer to 2,3-Dimethylbutane (1.3750 nD). Re-experimenting is suggested to verify if refraction index reading is correct and to confirm there are no user errors affecting the reading. 

# Answers to Post-Lab Questions  

1. Cyclohexane has the most identical data with 80.7 C Boiling point and 1.4266 n Refractive Index
2. The drop of atmospheric pressure decreases the boiling point of liquid; boiling point is "defined as the temperature that vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure". 
3. Three things that can affect boiling point of an organic compound is molar mass, its functional groups, and types of intermolecular forces that hold it together. Other factors can include ambient pressure, decreasing branching of isomeric molecules with same functional groups, and polarity.
4. $\ce{ H_{2}O }$ has a higher boiling point due to its high polarity of its composition.
