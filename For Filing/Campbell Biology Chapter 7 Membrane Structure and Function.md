# Concept 7.1 Cellular Membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins

[[Membranes]] are made of almost all types of [[Macromolecules]], but its mostly [[Lipids]], [[Proteins]], and a little bit of [[Carbohydrates]]. 

The primary constituent molecules of membranes are [[Phospholipids]], which are [[Amphipatic]].

[[Fluid Mosaic Model]], [[Amphipatic]] proteins are in the [[Phospholipid Bilayer]]
Some phospholipids and proteins move within the membrane
[[Unsaturated Fats]] cool the membrane
[[Cholesterols]] resist changes
[[Membrane Proteins]] function in trnasport and ezymatic activity, signal transduction, cell-cell recognition, intercellular joining and attachment to cytoskeleto
[[Glycoproteins]] and [[Glycolipids]] are on the exterior side of the plasma membrane
[[Membrane Proteins]] and [[Membrane Phospholipids]] are made in the ER and modified in the [[Golgi Apparatus]]

# Concept 7.2 Membrane Structures result in selective permeability

[[Selective Permeability]], [[Hydrophobic]] substances are soluble in [[Lipids]] and pass through the membrane easily

[[Polar Molecules]] and [[Ions]] need [[Transport Proteins]]

# Concept 7.3 Passive transport is diffusion of a substance across a membrane with no energy investment

[[Diffusion]] is the spontaneous movement of a substance down its [[Concentration Gradient]]
Water diffuses out of a cell via [[Osmosis]]

[[Solutions]] with higher concentrations of nonpenetrating solutes water enters if the solution has lower solute
[[Hypertonic]]
[[Hypotonic]]
[[Isotonic]]

[[Facilitated Diffusion]] transport protein speeds up water or solute movement its concentration gradient, [[Ion Channels]] facilitiate it

# Concept 7.4 Active Transport Uses energy to move solutes against their gradients

[[Active Transport]] uses ATP
[[Ions]] can have a Concentration Gradient of a Electrical Gradient
[[Electrochemical Gradient]] determines net direction of [[Ionic Diffusion]]
[[Cotransport]] of two solutes occur when a membrane protein enables downhill/uphill diffusion

# Concept 7.5 Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis 

[[Exocytosis]] invovles [[Transport Vesicles]] to migrate to the [[Plasma Membranes]], fuse with it, and release the contents

[[Endocytosis]] The plasma membrane pinches molecules
	[[Phagocytosis]] 
		Cellular eating
		Engulft a particle into a [[Food Vacuoles]]
		Fuses with [[Lysosomes]]
	[[Pinocytosis]] 
		Cellular Drinking
		Continuously gulpds fluid
	[[Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis]]
		Take in cholesterol for membrane synthesis and other steroids
		Aqcuire bulk quantity of specific substances
		Receptor sites that react to related targeted
