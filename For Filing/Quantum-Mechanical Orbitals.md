- [[Electrons]] orbit around an [[Atomic Nucleus]] depending on which [[Electron Shells]] it is located at
- For every electron orbiting an atomic nucleus, it progresses from shell 1 onwards
- $\ce{ s_{1} }$ contains up to two electrons that orbit in a spherical path
- $\ce{ s_{2} }$ contains up to eight electrons that orbit in the $\ce{ s }$ spherical orbit, and $p_{xyz}$ dumbbell orbit 
- $\ce{ s_{3} }$ posses the same orbitals from $s_{1}$, $s_{2}$, and its own

# Shell

Is the same as [[Principal Quantum Numbers]]
$\ce{ 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s }$
The number of [[Subshells]] start from 1 - 4
