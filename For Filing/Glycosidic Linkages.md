[[Glycosidic Linkages]] are [[Covalent Bonds]] between [[Carbohydrates|Saccharides]] and are formed through [[Dehydration Synthesis]], a type of [[Condensation Reactions]]. Depending on the orientation of a [[Hydroxyl Groups]] connected to the 1' carbon of a [[Glucose]] ring, the orientation can be  can be categorized as Alpha or Beta linkages, alpha positions are under the carbon skeleton, and beta positions are above the skeleton. 

[[Starch]] have all of its monomers in the $\alpha$ orientation, and [[Cellulose]] has its monomers in its $\beta$ orientation. [[Disaccharides]] can have different linkages based on what monomers are being bonded. 

Linkages are formed from the reaction of [[Anomeric Carbons]] of one cyclic monosaccharide and the OH group of another monosaccharide. The formation of the linkages and what monomers are used determines [[Disaccharides]]' identities.

The [[Disaccharides]], [[Maltose]], [[Sucrose]], and [[Lactose]]; have very specific linkages.
