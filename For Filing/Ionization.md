- Ionization is the act of an [[Atoms]] gaining or losing an [[Electrons]], giving it a positive or negative charge
- When [[Protons]] out number [[Electrons]] it gains a positive charge
- When [[Electrons]] out number [[Protons]] it gains a negative charge
- Ionization can be predicted by [[Electronegativity]] of an [[Atoms]]
- Oxygen of Group 6A of the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]] is known to have a charge of $^{2-}$ 
- [[Common Ionic States]] of [[Elements]] can be predicted by location in the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]]
