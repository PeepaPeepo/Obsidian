[[Prokaryotes]] are single celled organisms that make up Bacteria and Archaea 
Adapted to diverse and extreme environments, they are the most abundant

# Concept 27.1 Structural and funcitonal adaptions contribute to success

Prokaryote are first organisms
Most are unicellular
Most prokaryotic cells are 0.5 - 5 um

## Cell surface Structure 

Cell wall mainatains shape, protects cell from hypotonic enviornmetn

most prokaryotes lose water and experinece pasmolysis hypertonic environments
Most bacertial walls contain peptidoglycan

Arhaeal walls contain a variety of polysaccharides and proteins, but lack [[Peptidoglycan]]
Eukaryote cell wals are made of [[Cellulose]] and [[Chitin]]
[[Gram Stain]] 
[[Gram-Positive]] have simpler walls with large amount of peptidoglycan
[[Gram-Negative]] has less peptidoglycan and have [[Lipopolysaccharides]]
	Tend to be more resistant to antibiotis
	Antibiotics target peptidoglycan
	Humans lack peptidoglycan and are unaffected to antibiotics

## CEll Surface Structures

[[Capsule]] is. adense well defined or a [[Slime Layer]]
	Both types enable adherence to the substrate or other individuals, prevent dehydration, and protect teh cell from the hosts's immune systems 

Some bacteria form metabolically inactive [[Endospores]] when water or nutirents are lacking
Cell copies its chromosome and surrounds it with a multi layer strcuture
Endospores can withstand extreme conditions

[[Fimbriae]] allow them to stick to their substrate or other individual in a colony
[[Pili]] or [[Pili|Sex Pili]] are longer function to pull cells togther to exchange DNA

[[Motility]] half of prokaryotes show [[Taxis]] the ability to move towards or away from a stimulus
[[Chemotaxis]] is the movment towards from a away chemical stimulus
[[Flagella]] are comomn used by prokaryotes for movement
maybe scatttered over theentire surface
Falgella 

## Internal Organization of DNA

[[Prokaryotes]] cells lack complex campartmentalization
Some prokaryotes have specialed membranes that perform metabolic funcitons
These are usually infoldinds of cells membranes
[[Cyanobacteria]]
Prokaryotes have less DNa and produce fewer proteins than eukaryotes
Pro have One Circular Chromosome
Eukaryotes have multiple linear chromosomes
Pro lack a nucleus
The chromosome is the [[Nucleoid]], a region with no membrane
[[Prokaryotes]] have smaller rings of independently replicateing DNA called Plasmids

## Reproduction

Small
[[Binary Fission]]
1 - 3 hours under optimal conditons
Short generation times

# Concept 27.2 Rapid Reporoduction, mutation, and genetic recombination promote genetic diversity

[[Genetic Diversity]]
Rapid reproduciton
mutation
genetic recombination
Generally identical but difference comes from mutation

## Genetic Recombination

Combination of DNA from different sources

[[Transformation]]
[[Transduction]]
[[Conjugation]]

[[Horizontal Gene Transfer]] is the movement of genes between individual prokaryotes of different species

## Transformation 

Pro cells incorporate freing DNA from surroundings
Nonpathogenic cells can take up DNA carrying a pathgencity to replace its own allel

[[Transduction]] phages carry prokaryotic genes from one host cell to another
	generally an unintended result of the phage replicative cycle
[[Binary Fission]] is the division of cells
*E. coli*, chromosomes duplicate

## Conjugation and Plasmids

[[Conjugation]] is the process through which DNA is transferred between two prokaryotic cells

Bacteria tranfers DNA is always one way
Pilus of donor cell attaches to receiver

## F Factor as a Plasmid

Piece of DNA [[F Factor]] F fertility is required for production of Pili
Cell containing the [[F Plasmid]] function as DNA Donors F+ 
F- Cells 
F- converts to F+ 
Cells that haf the f factor in their chromosome 
[[High Frequency of Recombination Cells]] function as donors during conjugation
F Factor can be in a plasmid or chromosome

# R Plasmids and Anitibioitic Resistance

Antibioitds do not kill [[R Plasmids]], carries resistance genes
Some R Plasmids carry genes for resistance
R PLasmids also have genes that encode the pili used to transfer DNA between cells, enabling the rpaid spread of resistance

# Concept 27.3 Driverse nutritional and metabolic adaptations have evolved in prokaryotes

[[Phototrophs]]
[[Chemotrophs]]
[[Autotrophs]]

## Role of O2

[[Obligate Aerobes]]
[[Obligate Anaerobes]]
[[Anaerobic Respiration]]
[[Facultative Anaerobes]]

Nitrogen is essential for production of amino acids
Prokaryotes metabolize 
[[Nitrogen Fixation]]

## Metabolic Cooperation

Pro cells may cooperate to use resources unsavaialbe to indiviual cells
[[Cyanobacteria]] sepciliazed for nitrogen fixation or photo synehtis
Nitro fixation is isolated in cells called [[Heterocysts]]

## Biofilms

Cells of one or more prokaryote species cooperate to form [[Biofilm]]
Cells near edge release signalling molecules to recruit new cells
channels in the biofilm allow nutrients to reach cells in the interior and wasets to be expelled
