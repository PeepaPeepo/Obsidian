# 09/14/2023 Lecture

- Atoms are foundation of our sensations
- Rocks are made of  silicates compound of silicon and oxygen
- Sea air has nitrogen and oxygen
	- can contain [[Amines]]
- Trethyalmine is emitted by decaying fish
- [[Trethylamine]] contributes to fishy smell
	- 3 ethyl's  (C_2H+5) replaces H in NH_3

## How many atoms are in a pebble?

- Atoms are very small
- Pebbles are almost unconceivable
- One pebble contains more atoms than the number of pebbles in the SF bay

## Atoms and Elements

- About 91 [[Natural Elements]] 
- Smallest unit of an element is one [[Atoms]]
- There about 20 [[Synthetic Elements]]
- Some synthetic elements might be considered as Natural elements

## Atomic Theory of Democritus: What Cannot Be Divided

- [[Democritus]] and [[Leucippus]] thought of the ideas of atoms
- Indestructible elements
- Democritus called them Atomos or [[Atoms]]
- First person to postulated the idea

## Atomic Theory of Dalton

- [[John Dalton]]
- Theory in three parts
	- Tiny indestructible parts called atoms
	- atoms of a given element have the same mass
	- atoms combine in simple whole number ratios to make [[Compounds|Compounds]]
- $\ce{ CO_2 => O:C }$

## Modern Evidence for the Atomic Theory

- [[IBM]] has [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] STM to move xenon atoms
- Atoms are typically spherical 

## Thomson's Discovery of Electrons Shows Atoms Have parts

- J.J. Thomson discovered [[Electrons]]
- Electrons are negatively charged
- They are much smaller compared to the [[Neutrons|Neutron]] and [[Protons|Proton]]
- It barely affects the majority of the mass
- He proposed that electrons are balanced by some positive charge in the atom
- Electrons occupy [[Electron Shells|Electron Shells]]
- [[Plum Pudding Model of the Atom]] models an atom as a positive sphere with electrons within itself

## Rutherford's Experiments Requires a New Model

- [[Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment]]
- $\alpha$ particles were shot at cold foil
- Radioactive isotopes release neutrons
- Alpha particle is helium
- Some particles were directed in different directions

## Rutherford Proposes a Nuclear Theory of the Atom

- If [[Plum Pudding Model of the Atom]] was accurate, the rays would pass straight through

## Statement by Rutherford of the Nuclear Theory of the Atom

- Most of mass is in [[Atomic Nucleus]]
- Most volume is the empty space the [[Electrons]] occupy
- The number of number of electrons equal the number of [[Protons]] to create a neutral charged atom

## Distribution of Mass in the Atom is Not Uniform

- [[Atomic Nucleus]] is very dense but takes up small volume
- Electrons are less dense and but occupy larger space

## Relative Size of the Proton and the Electron

- Proton is almost 2000 times larger than an electron

## Electrical Charge is a Property of Protons and Electrons

- Electrical charge is fundamental property of protons and electrons
- Opposing charge attracts

## The Properties of Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons

- Protons and Neutrons have similar mass
- Electrons have much less mass relative to Nucleic sub-particles
- Number of Neutrons determine an element's [[Isotopes|Isotope]]
	- $^{21}Ne$
	- $^{22}Ne$
	- $^{23}Ne$

## Electrical Storm Provides Evidence of Charge in Matter 

- Electrical storm the charge balance of matter is disturbed 
- Quick rebalance results in electrical discharge

# How Atoms of the Element Differ from One Another

- Elements are defined the number of [[Protons]] it contains
- They can have different Electron orbital occupancy
- The number of protons an element has is its Elemental Number and the given number is Z

## Table of Elements by Atomic Number

- From left to right, the atomic number increases
- The Atomic number is the number of protons
- Neutrons = Atomic Mass or Weight - Atomic Number
- Atomic Weight is the average of an element's isotopes
- Electrons are equal to the number of Protons to satisfy the neutral charge requirement 

## Origin of the Names and Symbols of the Elements

- Most based on English name
- Some are based on Latin
- Potassium is K for Kalium
- Na for Natrium
- Latin Based Symbols
	- Lead
	- mercury
	- iron
	- silver
	- tin
	- copper

## Looking for Patterns: Dmitri Mendeleev

- When organized in atomic number, some properties recur periodically
- Na and K have similar physical properties

## Periodic Law Summarizes Many Observations

- Mendeleev's periodic law was based on observation

## Locating Metals, Nonmetals, Metalloids on the Periodic Table

- [[Metals]], [[Nonmetals]], [[Metalloid]]

## Typical Metal Properties

- Occupy the left side of the periodic Table and similar properties
- Can conduct metal and electricity
- Malleability
- Can be draw into wires Ductility
- Lustrous
- ***Tend to lose electrons during reactions***
- Iron, magnesium, chromium, and sodium 

## Nonmetals

- Upper right of of Table
-  Tend to gain electrons during reaction
- Oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, iodine
-
