[[Strong Acids]] completely [[Disassociation|Disassociates]] in [[Aqueous Solutions]], its [[Molecules]] will break into its [[Constituent Elements]] as [[Ions]] in water. 

There are only few [[Strong Acids]] known, and anything that doesn't disassociates 100% is classified as [[Weak Acids]].

# Strong Acids

$\ce{ HCl }$
$\ce{ HBr }$
$\ce{ HI }$
$\ce{ HNO_{3} }$
$\ce{ H_{2}SO_{4} }$
$\ce{ HClO_{3} }$
$\ce{ HClO_{4} }$

Common [[Elements]] in those acids are $\ce{ Cl, Br, I, N, S }$
