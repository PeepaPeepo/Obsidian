[[Active Sites]] are areas that [[Free Substrates]] bind to that [[Catalysis|Catalyze]] [[Chemical Reactions]]. The [[Free Energy of Activation|Energy of Activation]] for a [[Substrates]] is changed in different ways.

[[Active Sites]] sites can pull two [[Free Substrates]] and have them [[Chemical Reactions|React]] into their [[Products]].
They can stretch [[Substrates]] get it closer to their [[Transition States]] and weakening their [[Chemical Bonds]].
They can provide a difference in [[Potential of Hydrogen|pH]] through [[Acids|Acidic]] or [[Bases|Basic]] [[Amino Acids]].
They can form brief [[Covalent Bonds]] to cause a different reaction, then restored with the previous methods.
