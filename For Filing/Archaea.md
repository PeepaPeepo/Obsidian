[[Archaea]] is are one the [[Domains]] and is made up of [[Euryarchaeota]] and [[Thaumarchaeotes Aigarchaeotes Crenarchaeotes Korarchaeotes]]. [[Thaumarchaeotes Aigarchaeotes Crenarchaeotes Korarchaeotes]] is an acronym of [[Thaumarchaeota]], [[Aigarchaeota]], [[Crenarchaeota]], and [[Korarchaeota]].

Archaea share certain traits with bacteria and other traits with eukaryotes. They contain severial [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerases]] and Initiator Amino Acids are [[Methionine]].

They are typically [[Extremophiles]] which include [[Extreme Halophiles]] and [[Extreme Thermophiles]]. They can tolerate either high saline or high temperatures.

[[Methanogens]] are obligate [[Obligate Anaerobes]] that produce [[Methane]]
[[Euryarchaeota]] is a clade that includes many of the extreme halophiles, most methogens, and some extreme thermophiles.

[[Crenarchaeota]] of [[Thaumarchaeotes Aigarchaeotes Crenarchaeotes Korarchaeotes|TACK]] includes most of the extreme [[Extreme Thermophiles]]

One distinctive features that archaea have compared to bacteria is that their membrane are made hydrocarbons linked with [[Ether Linkages]].
