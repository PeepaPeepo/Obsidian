$$\ce{ AAUAAA }$$

[[Polyadenylation Signal Sequence]] is a specific sequence on [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] which specificies a Polyadenylation Signal in [[Precursor-Messenger Ribonucleic Acids|pre-mRNA]].

When the sequence of $\ce{ AAUAAA }$ appears, it is bound by specific proteins in the [[Cell Nucleus]], then about 10-35 [[Nucleotides]] downstream, the [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] transcript is cut free from the [[Ribonucleic Acid Polymerases|RNA Polymerase]]
