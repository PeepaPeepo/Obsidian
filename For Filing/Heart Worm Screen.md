# Introduction

Mosquitos can be gene screened to see if they contain any parasitic Heart Worms. "Modge Podge" Mosquito samples will be used for DNA Isolation, PCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis. Its DNA will be primed with Heart Worm A and Heart Worm B primers to amplify any related DNA from the Modge Podge specimen. 

# Material and Methods

## Part 1A: DNA Isolation and Purification Protocol via Muddled Hodge Podge

10/10/2023
Acquired 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and added 3 Hodge Podge specimen, 200 uL of PBS, 200 uL of Buffer AL, and 20 uL of Proteinase K. Muddled with reusable plastic pestle, then added mixture to heating block for 15 m at $\ce{ 56^oC }$. Inverted tube 3 times every 5 minutes of incubation.

Transferred 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to eppendorf Centrifuge 5415 D at 3.0 RPM for 1 minute. Realized lid was off, restarted at 5 s left. Using a p1000 added 200 uL of Ethanol EtOH and vortexed for 15 s. j

Acquired a new DNeasy Mini Spin Column and labeled it as "PC". Transferred 230 uL lysate solution onto white disc of spin column. Centrifuged for 6000 x g for 1 m, dumped the flow through liquid. Centrifuged for 6.0 rpm for 1m.

Using p1000 added 500 uL of AW1 Buffer. Centrifuged at 6.0 rpm for 1 m. Dumped flow through liquid

Using p1000 added 500 uL of AW2 buffer and centrifuged for 17,000 x g for 3 minutes on accuSpin Micro 17. Dumped flow through liquid.

Transferred the spin column to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge labeled "PC". Added 50 uL of Buffer AE and incubated at room temperature for 5 m. Transferred and process at centrifuge for 6.0 RPM at 1 min. 

## Part 1B: DNA Concentration Quantification via NanoDrop Spectrophotometry

Cleaned NanoDrop 2000 with Kimi wipe and blanked with 2 uL AE Buffer. Cleaned with Kimwipe, added 2 uL of purified Hodge Podge DNA, processed for DsDNA. Documented results with Pixel 7A Smartphone with auto settings.

## Part 2: Preparation of PCR Samples and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

Acquired 2 new PCR tubes labeled "PC HWA" and "PC HWB", added the following in each tube: 10 uL "ProMega 2X PCR Master Mix", 3 uL Ultra Pure Water,  and 5 uL of purified Hodge Podge DNA. Added 2 uL of Heart Worm A primer to "PC HWA" and 2 uL of Heart Worm B Primer to "PC HWB"


Placed your labeled PCR tube into a thermocycler/PCR machine and processed with the following parameters. 
  
Initial Denaturation 95 °C 2 minutes 1  Cycles
Denaturation 95 °C 30 seconds  40 Cycles
Annealing 60 °C 30 seconds  40 Cycles 
Extension 72 °C 1 minute  40 Cycles 
Final Extension 72 °C 7 minutes 1  Cycle
Hold 4 °C ∞ 1  
  
Samples placed in freezer at -20 C.
  
## Part 3: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of PCR Samples  

10/12/2023, Performed by Maya C.
Measured out 1.0 gram of agarose powder. Added the powder to a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask and set it aside. Added 50 mL of the newly prepared 1X TAE buffer into the flask containing the agarose powder. 
  
Placed the flask into the microwave and heated for 60 seconds, swirling the flask every 30 seconds to ensure that a clear solution is achieved. Into the molten gel, add 3 μL of GelRed prior to pouring.  
  
Obtained a casting tray. Inserted a well comb into the slots to the very left of the tray. Attached barriers to either side of the casting tray. Once the gel has slightly cooled, pour it into the casting tray until a thickness of ~0.5 cm is achieved. Make sure that the well comb is positioned towards the left of the gel.  
  
Removed the well comb and the barriers when gel solidified. Place the gel and casting tray into the gel box. Depending on the size of the gel box, you may be able to accommodate two gels.  
  
Added 1X TAE buffer into both of the bilateral reservoirs until the gel is adequately submerged. Using a p20 micropipette, added 5 μL of loading dye to a piece of Parafilm. To the loading dye, added 5 μL of your PCR product. Pipette up and down until well mixed. Using a p20 micropipette, pipette 10 μL of the colored PCR product into an empty well.  
  
Onto a fresh piece of Parafilm, combined 5 μL of molecular weight marker (MWM) + 2 μL of loading dye (LD) + 3 μL of 1X TAE. Using a p20 micropipette, pipette the 10 μL sample of MWM/LD/TAE into an empty well.  
   
Assembled the gel electrophoresis box and processed gel for ~45 minutes at 100 Volts. Took a photograph of the agarose gel (via ChemiDoc and Image Lab software).   

# Results

**Figure 1:** NanoDrop 2000 Results of Isolated Modge Podge Specimen DNA.

**Figure 2**: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Results performed by Maya C.

DNA Isolation results, as seen in Figure 1, seems successful based on "Thermo Scientific T042‐TECHNICAL BULLETIN NanoDrop Spectrophotometers" ideal 260/280 ratios. A260/A280 value of 1.8 or higher is considered pure DNA. 

Figure 2 Agarose gel shows no evidence of Heart Worm traits seen in sample Paolo A (PCHWA) and Paolo B (PCHWB). There is partial evident in Maya A and Maya B, the streak of DNA implicates there might be evidence of heart worm traits in their sample specimen. Would redo experiment to verify results in hopes to find a clear image.

# Discussion

Experiment went well until the electrophoresis, there is partial evidence that Maya C.'s unknown sample may have had heart worm related DNA as apposed to Paolo's Hodge Podge Sample. Though there was exact amounts of reagents, there are worries that Paolo's Hodge Podge PCR reagents might be lacking by tenths of microliters. Experimental process was favorable, but would consider re-experimenting with Maya C's Samples.

Overall, DNA isolation yields good results, assuming if A260/A280 value of 1.85 is the ideal goal. Possible inverting the Sample of muddled hodge podge during heat block incubation might have improved results of DNA concentration.

# Conclusion

Modge Podge Mosquito specimen shows no evidence of Heart Worm A or B DNA, but Maya C.'s Specimen may. Considering most of the experimentation went ideally, the Modge Podge specimen can be confirmed to have no heart worm. Maya's sample shows streaks on the agarose gel, showing that there is potential heart worm in her sample. Highly recommend redoing experiment to confirm results with Maya's Sample.
