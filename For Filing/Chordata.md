[[Chordata]] is a [[Phyla|Phylum]] of the [[Animalia|Kingdom Anamalia]] and has four defining features: 

[[Notochord]], a longitudinal, flexible rod between the digestive tube and nerve cord
	Provides a flexible skeletal support during early developments and in adults that keep it
	Most vertebrates develop a complex jointed skeleton
Dorsal, hollow [[Nerve Cords]] develops from a plate of [[Ectoderm]] rolled into a neural tube dorsal to the notochord 
	Develops into the brain and spinal cord
[[Pharyngeal Clefts]]
	Develops into [[Pharyngeal Slits]] that open into [[Pharynx]]
	Allows water to pass from mouth to outside of body
	Suspension feeding structures
	Mod into gills
	Mods into parts of ear, head and neck
[[Post-Anal Tails]]
	Propelling forces for most aquatic species
	Greatly reduced during embryotic development
