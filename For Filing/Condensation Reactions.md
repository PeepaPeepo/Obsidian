- A reaction that forms [[Polymers]] from [[Monomers]] by condensing a [[Molecules]] from the ends of each [[Monomers]]
- In most cases the common [[Condensation Reactions]] reaction is a [[Dehydration Synthesis]] where [[Monomers]]' hydrogens form a $H_{2}O$ molecule with a neighboring [[Hydroxyl Groups]] functional group of another [[Monomers]]
