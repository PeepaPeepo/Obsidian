[[Starch|Starches]] are [[Polysaccharides]] made of [[Glucose]] and are stored in [[Kingdom Plantae]] as granules known as [[Plastids]]. The [[Synthesis Reactions]] of starch lets plants stockpile surplus [[Glucose]]. Plants must [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] starch into [[Monomers|monomers]] to be used as nutrients for [[Cells]]. Common sources of starch are Potatoes, tubers, corn, rice, and other grasses.

Starch is a mixture of two [[Polymers]]: [[Amylose]] and [[Amylopectin]]. Amylose has [[Glucose]] with 1' - 4' [[Glycosidic Linkages]] and form a coiled unbranched [[Polymers|polymer]]. [[Amylopectin]] contains the same 1' - 4' [[Glycosidic Linkages]] between each [[Glucose]] [[Monomers]], but occasionally forms an 1' - 6' alpha link every 25 - 30 glucose monomers.
