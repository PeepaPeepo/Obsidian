1. All non-zero digits are significant
2. Interior numbers are significant
3. Trailing zeroes are right of a fall after a decimal point is significant 1.0 
4. Trailing zero that falls before a decimal point are significant 
	1. 20.2 
5. Leading zeroes before non-zero is insignificant
6. Trailing zeros at the end are ambiguous and avoided with scientific notation
	1. 2400 is ambiguous
		1. this is 2 sig figs and ambiguous
	2. $2.4*10^{3}$
7. Leading zeroes are insignificant

When recording instrument values, the last digit is always estimated
Certain/Absolute values and uncertain
Depends on the glass ware 
Volumetric pipette example 25ml - written as 25.0 ml

[[Accuracy]] vs [[Precision]]

- Accurate and not precise
- Accurate precise
- Not accurate but precise

Significant figures defines precision in values

# Operation Rules

Multiplication and division keeps the rounds to the least amount of sig figs
Addition and Subtraction keeps the least amount of decimal places
Always resort to scientific notation

states that the last digit written is the first digit with some [[Uncertainty]]
