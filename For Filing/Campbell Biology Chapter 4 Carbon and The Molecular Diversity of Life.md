# Working with Moles and Molar Ratios (58)

# Concept 4.2 Carbon atoms can form diverse molecules by bonding to four other atoms

- Atom's chemical characteristics is influenced by [[Electron Configurations]]
- Determines types and quantity of bonds it can form

## The Formation of Bonds with Carbon

- [[Carbon]] has 6 Electrons
- [[Valence]] of 4
- Organic molecules, usually forms single or double covalent bonds
- Acts like an intersection point
- Molecule can branch off in 4 directions

	- Methane
	- When carbon has single bonds, the shape is tetrahedra 
	- Ethane
	- Molecule can have more than one tetrahedral group of single bonded atoms
	- Ethene (ethylene)
	- When 2 carbons are double bonded, all atoms will attach in the same plane
- Bond angle in methane CH_4 are 109.5˚
