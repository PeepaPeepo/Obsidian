[[Alpha Helices]] are [[Secondary Structures]] of [[Proteins]] that are determined by the sequence of [[Amino Acids]] in its [[Polypeptides]]. They are coils that are held together by [[Hydrogen Bonds]] every fourth [[Amino Acids|Amino Acid]] in its sequence. 

Some [[Side Chains]] should not be in helices like [[Proline]], which is a helix breaker. [[Glycine]] leaves too much space. Loops cause disruptions of side chains. Acidic and basic bases should alternate.
