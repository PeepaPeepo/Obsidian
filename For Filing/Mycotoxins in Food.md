# Mycotoxins in Food

Paolo Canuto
Jennifer Lloyd
BIOL 140A
10/03/2023 - 10/05/2023

# Introduction

**O Organics Baby Food Apples 4 oz** will be screened for any presence of Patulin, a Mycotoxin that can be found in rotting apples and processed food. DNA will be isolated from the ready made baby food and will be purified. PCR will be used to amplify mycotoxin genes and will be analyzed through gel electrophoresis to determine if the baby food has mycotoxins.

# Materials and Methods

## Part 1A 

10/03/2023
Added half a 1.5 mL Microcentrifuge tube with "Organics APPLES Organic baby food", then diluted it with $\ce{ 400 \mu L }$ AP1 Buffer with p1000 pipette. Transferred $\ce{ 500\mu L }$ of baby food  AP1 mix to new tube and labeled it "BAF and 400 AP1". Incubated new centrifuge tube in heat block at $\ce{ 65^oC }$ for 10 minutes. Inverted three times to induce lysis.

Took out BAF 400 AP1 Mix and added $\ce{ 130 \mu L }$ of Buffer P3 with a p200 pipette. Placed Mini centrifuge tube in ice for 5 minutes. Placed mini centrifuge tube in centrifuge and processed it at 6,000 x g for 5 minutes. Mixture was visibly uniform still, added to other centrifuge and processed 10 RCF for 1 minute on accident. Mixture had no effective separation; processed in centrifuged at 13 RPM for 1 minute.

Using p1000, transferred lysate solution onto white disc of spin column in new purple QIAshredder mini spin column and labeled as "10/03/2023 PC-SABF". Placed QIA Shredder mini spin column in in centrifuge and processed at 10,000 x g for 2 minutes. 

Transferred flow-through fraction to 1.5 mL labelled "Apple Lysate PC" and used p1000 to determine volume of 500 uL of apple lysate. Calculated required AW1 buffer to add to solution with the following formula.

$$\ce{ Vol of Lysate * 1.5 = Vol of AW{1} }$$

Using p1000 pipette, transferred 650 uL of lysate to DNeasy spin column labelled "PC" and centrifuged for 6,000 x g for 1 minute. Repeated process for remaining lysate and dumped flow through liquid from DNeasy. Added 500 uL of AW2 Buffer onto white disc of spin column and centrifuged for 6,000 x g for 1 minute. Added another 500 uL of AW2 Buffer onto white disc of spin column and centrifuged for 6,000 x g for 2 minutes. Dumped flow through liquid again.


Continued to centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 2 minutes, and dumped flow through liquid. Acquired fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and labeled lid with "PC". Added 50 uL of buffer AE with p100 pipette to spin column. Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes,
centrifuged 50uL Buffer AE mix at 6,000 x g for 1 minute.

## Part 1B: DNA Concentration Quantification via NanoDrop Spectrophotometry

10/03/2023
Cleaned NanoDrop 2000 with Kimwipe set to double strand reading. Blanked the machine with 2 uL of AE buffer and set sample name to "Canuto", cleaned again with kimwipe and transferred 2 uL of DNA sample. Took photo of results with Pixel 7a Smartphone on Auto settings, and cropped photo.

## Part 2: Preparation of PCR Samples and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

10/03/2023
In a new PCR tube labelled "PC, 10/03/2023, ABF, PCR" added the following reagents: 10 uL ProMega 2X PCR Master Mix, 2 uL of PAT Primer (includes 1.0 uL of forward primer and 1.0 uL reverse primer), 5 uL of "Pure ABF", and 3 uL of ultra-pure water.

PCR mixture was processed with the following parameters:

| Function             | Temperature | Time     | Cycles |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ |
| Initial Denaturation | 95˚ C        | 120 s    | 1      |
| Denaturation         | 95˚ C        | 30 s     | 40     |
| Annealing            | 53˚ C        | 30 s     | 40     |
| Extension            | 72˚ C        | 60 s     | 40     |
| Final Extension      | 72˚ C        | 420 s    | 1      |
| Hold                 | 4˚ C         | infinite | 1      |

Sample was frozen at -20˚C until next session.

# Part 3: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis

10/05/2023 
Measured 1.093 g of agarose powder in analytical balance and added the powder to a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask to make a 2% solution. Using a 100mL graduated cylinder added stock 50.0 mL 1X TAE buffer to Erlenmeyer flask and swirled. Placed in to microwave for 60 s and swirled every 30 s. Added 3 uL of GelRed to 2% solution and poured into Bio Rad Mini-Sub Cell GT. Removed well comb and barriers after gel solution solidified. Filled bilateral reservoirs until reached max capacity.

Using a p20 pipette, added 5 uL loading dye and 5 uL of Apple Baby food PCR product; pipetted repeatedly to mix. Added the 10 uL homogenous mixture in to well 1. Repeated again to make a total of 20 uL mixture.

Using a p20 pipette, mixed 5 uL of MWM, 2 uL Loading Dye, and 3 uL of 1X TAE on Parafilm. Transferred 10 uL mixture to well 8. Assembled Bio Rad Mini-Sub Cell GT and ran the gel for 45 minutes at 100 v. Transferred gel to BIO RAD GelDoc Go Imaging System. Took photo of results with Pixel 7a smart phone on automatic settings.

**Figure 1:** NanoDrop 2000 Concentration reading of DNA prepared from Organics APPLES Organic baby food.

**Figure 2:** Gel electrophoresis results of Pure DNA PCR and MWM.

DNA isolation and purification yielded a high DNA concentration in ng/uL, but had a satisfactory A260/A280 ratio of 1.11. Relative to pure DNA being around 1.8+, the DNA purification could have been better. After PCR and processed through gel electrophoresis, there is no evidence of Mycotoxin genes within in the baby food.

# Discussion

Overall experiment went according to the manual, and yielded no evidence of mycotoxin within ***O Organics Baby Food Apples 4 oz***. 120.6 ng/uL was perceived to be thought to be a high concentration, the ratio of A260/A280 of 1.11 can be improved. Difficulties working with the sample arose from the viscosity of the baby food, and the manual didn't go over working with this type of substance. Unsure if 120.6 ng/uL is a good result, or if it means there is there is some sort of contamination other than DNA. Figure 2 shows that there is no evidence of mycotoxins within the baby food, which is ideal since its a mass produced food that is sold multiple locations. 

# Conclusion

***O Organics Baby Food Apples 4 oz*** does not contain any evidence of the mycotoxin Patulin. The process of isolating, purifying, PCR, and gel electrophoresis is an effective and accurate way of detecting specific genes within a DNA sample. Suggestions include different dilutions or methods of processing the baby food so it's easier to work with to improve A260/A280 ratio.
