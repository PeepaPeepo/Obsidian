- Nonpolar [[Molecules|molecules]] have 2 or more [[Atoms|atoms]] that share [[Electrons|electrons]] equally
- When [[Electronegativity]] of the atoms in a molecule are similar or the same, the electrons have no bias to a specific atom to orbit around
- Nonpolarity prevents any partial charges in atoms of a molecule as opposed to [[Polar Covalent Bonds|polar covalent bonds]]
- [[Diatomic Elements]] such as $O_2$ and $H_2$ have [[Nonpolar Covalent Bond|nonpolar covalent bonds]]
