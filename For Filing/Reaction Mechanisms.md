[[Reaction Mechanisms]] is a technique that depicts the flow of electrons within a reaction by using curved arrows. The curved arrows show electron origin and destinations. All Ionic Mechanisms are are a combination of four characteristic patterns: Nucleophilic Attack, Proton Transfer, Loss of a Leaving group, and Rearrangements.

# Nucleophilic Attack

A [[Nucleophilic Attacks]] is when a source of a negative charge attacks a positive charge and form a bond. [[Nucleophiles]] are can be anions, or double/triple bonds. Examples would include taking two electrons, either a lone pair or bonded pair from a pi bond, then linking them to a [[Electrophile]].

Nucleophiles do not exclusively attack visible positive partial charges, they can attack atoms that uneven sharing of electrons.

# Loss of Leaving Group

[[Loss of Leaving Groups]] is another pattern where atoms detach from the initial molecule, and taking its original bonding pair it had and holding it as an extra lone pair that gives the group a formal charge.

# Proton Transfer

[[Proton Transfers]] occur when a nucleophile grabs an H proton, in this case the nucleophiles source of electrons becomes a bonded pair with the Hydrogen; H's original bonding pair migrates to its parent molecule.

# Rearrangements 

[[Rearrangements]] is another pattern where structures rearrange their form to stable form (most of the time). The most common is a [[Carbocation Rearrangements]], where either a [[Methyl Shift]] occurs, or a [[Hydride Shift]] occurs.
