[[Electrolytes]]

[[Solubility]] at different [[Temperature]]

[[Henry's Law]]

The higher the pressure of a gas above a liquid, the more soluble the gas is in the liquid
[[Mass Percent Compositions|Mass Percent]] is the number of grams of solute per 100g of solution
14% = 14g/100g

Qualitative and Quantitative data

[[Parts per Million]]
[[Parts per Billion]]
[[Molarity]] 

[[Dilution]] $\ce{ M_{1}V_{1}=M_{2}V_{2} }$ applies only to solution dilution
[[Stock Solutions]] are substances in bulk that can be diulted

## Ion Concentration

Break into [[Net Ionic Equations]] and can calculate [[Molarity]] per element

[[Freezing Point Depression]] depends on amount of [[Solubility|Solute]] and should be 
[[Volatile|Nonvolatile]] doesn't evaporate easily (Lower boiling point)
[[Colligative Properties]] depends on amount of soluble
[[Coolant]] is literally the same non voltaitle
[[Elevation in Boiling Point]] can be done with solute and has to be nonvolatile

$\ce{ \Delta T_{f} = m*K_{f} }$
$\ce{ _{f} }$ = freezing
$\ce{ _{b} }$ = Boiling

[[Molality]] $\ce{ m = \frac{mol of solute}{kg of solvent} }$

## Boiling point elevation of a non-electrolyte solution is quantified 

$\ce{ \Delta T_{b} = m*K_{b} }$

Frogs have high concentration of nonvolatile fluid and can survive lower temps

## Osmosis Why drinking salt water causes dehydration

The flow of [[Solvent]] from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution
High concentration solutes draw solvent from solutions containing a lower concentration
Sewater is a thirsty solution
[[SemiPermeability]] membrane
Osmosis is a type of [[Colligative Properties]]

8moles/1kg solvent vs 4mol/1kg solvent
The solvent is transferring to the higher concentration to reach an equilibrium

## In an osmosis cell

Water flows through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated solution
[[Osmotic Pressure]] like freezing point depression and other colligative propteries depends on ceoncentration of the solute and not the type of solute
HIgher concentration have greated osmotic pressure

## Chemistry and Health: Solutions in Medicine

Solutions have osmotic pressure less thant body fluids are called [[Hypoosomtic]] and [[Hyperosomtic]]
Equal pressure solution is [[Isoosmotic]]

# 13.2 Solutions: Homogeneous Mixtures

[[Solutions]] can be composed of 2 or more [[Substances]] of any [[States of Matter]]
The majority component is typically the [[Solvent]] and the minority is called a [[Solute]]
In solid liquid solutions, liquids are typically solvents regardless of relative proportions
Polar solvents dissolve polar or ionic solutes
nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar solutes

# 13.3 Solutions of Solids Dissolved in Water: How to make rock candy

[[Solute-Solute Interactions]]
[[Solvent-Solute Attractions]]
Formation of [[Hydration Shells]] with water molecules and ions

## Solubility and Saturations

[[Solubility]] is the amount of the compound in grams that can dissolve in a liquid
[[Saturated Solutions]] hold maximum amount of solute under solution conditions
[[Unsaturated Solutions]] hold less max amount of solute
[[Supersaturated Solutions]] hold more than normal max, but solute precipitates

## Electrolyte Solutions: Dissolved Ionic Solids

Sugar solutions and salt solutions are different
Molecules of sugar vs ions of salt
Ions in salt solution are mobile charged particles and are conductive
[[Electrolyte Solutions]] contain solutes that dissociates into ions
[[Nonelectrolyte]] solutions do not conduct

## How Solubility varies with Temperature

Solubility of solids in water increases along with temperature
[[Recrystallization]] puts solids in heated solvents at higher temperature and cool it down 
Crystals appear when cooled down slowly, tends to reject impurities

# 13.4 Solutions of Gases in Water: How Soda Pop Gets Its Fizz

[[Solubility]] of gasses decreases with increasing temperature
Bubbles in boiling solvent are gases leaving solution 
Solubility increases with higher pressure above a liquid
[[Henry's Law]]

# 13.5 Specifying Solution Concentration: Mass Percent

[[Dilute Solutions]] contain small amounts of solute relative to solvent
[[Concentrated Solution]] is the opposite

Reporting solution concentration is mass percent

## Mass Percent

[[Mass Percent Compositions|Mass Percent]] is 
$$\ce { \frac{Mass solute}{Mass Solute + Mass Solvent}*100\%}$$
