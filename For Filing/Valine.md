[[Valine]], abbreviated as Val or V, an [[Amino Acids|amino acid]] where its [[Side Chains|side chain]] is compromised of only [[Methyl Group|methyl groups]], just like [[Alanine]], [[Leucine]], [[Isoleucine]], and [[Proline]]. A pair of $-CH_{3}$ connects to a single $- CH$ that connects to the backbone. It's almost like Alanine doubled and linked to a $-CH$. The side chain makes the amino acid nonpolar.
