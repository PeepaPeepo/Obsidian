## Deoxyribonucleic Acid DNA

- Ribonucleic acid
- Difference is sugar
	- pentene ring
		- 1 - 5 prime is each carbon
	- Ribose vs deoxyribose
	- Carbon and nitrogen bases
	- Nomencalture 
		- if prime exists, we are talking about a sugar
	- Ribose
		- 1 prime
		- 2 $-OH$
		- 3 $-OH$
		- 4
		- 5
	- Deoxy
		- 1
		- 2 $-H$
		- 3 $-OH$
		- 4
		- 5
- Biology is the most powerful technology ever creted
- DNA is software, proteins are hardware, cells are factories
- Arvind Gupta
- Understanding the importance
- Taking information from humans and gives it to off spring
- DNA has 4 alphabetical letters
- **4 Bases**
	- Purines
		- ADE [[Adenine]]
		- GUA [[Guanine]]
	- [[Pyrimidines]]
		- CYT [[Cytosine]]
		- URA  [[Urail]]
			- RNA has thymine
		- THY [[Thymine]]
			- DNA has thymine
- DNA
	- Deoxy
	- Thymine
	- Bases
		- Adensine
		- Cytosine
		- Thymine
		- Guanine
- DNA is double strandend
	- more stable
	- Contains base pairs
		- 6 x 10 ^9 base pairs
	- Adenine has two hydro bonds with thymine
	- Guanine triple hydrogen bonds cytosine
- RNA is single stranded 
	- Ade double to URA
	- Gua triple to CYT
- Glycosidic Bond
	- ADE
		- Containing sugar
		- [[Pentoses]]
		- Sugar at N9
		- Dixoy ribose Binds at 1 prime position
			- It is a base

## Plasmid 

- extrachromosol
- replicate
- contains genes = gfp
- circulate
- selective marjer
- promotor
- glow for attracting prey

## Co-factors

- enzymes use it 

## Bases

- [[Adenine]]
- [[Guanine]]
- [[Thymine]]
- [[Cytosine]]

- Nucleoside
- 5 Prime position contains a phosphate group 
- Deoxyadenosine Triphosphate dATP
	- Negative charges repel from each other
	- Chelating
		- Using Mg 2+ to neutrilize oxygen
	- Nucleotide
		- base, sugar, and phosphate
			- each of phosphate from starting closesest from penten ring
				- alpha phosphate
					- dictates creation of phosopher die-ster bond froms backbone to dna and rna 
				- beta
				- gamma
- Deoxyguanosine Triphosphate dGTP
- Deoxythymidine Triphosphate dTTP
- Deoxycytidine Triphosphate dCTP
- Triphosphate connects to Doexyed ribose to the that lone -H 
	- Only alpha phosphate connects to the lonate and condenses
	- Breaks bond of gamma + beta phospate

## General Nomenclature

- dNTP
	- d = deoxy
	- n nuclelotide
	- tri-phosphate
	- can be any for the 4 dna bases
	- Rna is not de-oxygenated
- dNDP = ndp
	- lack of gamma phosphate
- dNMP NMP
	- Missing gamma and beta phosphate
	- monophospate
- Replace N with base initial letter
- Can do this with precussor bases
- Adenine
	- dATP
	- ADP
	- AMP
- Activated bases
	- MUST be in ATP
	- Triphosphate ring
- Polymerization
	- Polymerizing a new strand

## Polymerization Reaction for both DNA and RNA

- No different from other macro molecules
- Dehydration or condensation reaction
- Note which positions participate in glylcocidic bond
- Alpha phopshate creates nucleophilic attack
	- A lot of electrons to share
	- OH is attracted to Alpha phosphate O- 
	- Forms a phospho diester bond
	- Gamma and Beta gets released
		- Gamma and beta together is ==Pyrophospate==
		- Breaking gamma and beta bond
		- Broken down by pyrophosphatee
		- 2 molecules fo inorganic phosphate 

## DNA Polymerares

- Enzymes that make DNA

## RNA Polymerases 

- Enzymes that Make RNA

- DDDP
	- DNA Dependent NA Polymerares 
- DDRPP
	- DNA Dependent RNA Polymerases

## Deoxyribonucleic Acid

- Two hydrogen bond
- 5 prime positoin is usually a phosphate group
- 4 prime is free -OH group
- Adding to -OH group

## Anti-Parallel

- one strand to 5 prime to 3 prime
- Then blip other to 3 prime to 5 prime
- creates bases to be opitmized for hydrogen bonds
- DNA is highly malleable 
- Bases are nitrogenous bases
	- highly hydrophobic
	- Pushes water out
	- Greates a helix
- Backbone
	- is hydrophilic
	- phoshate groups a
- Helix expells water
	- Forms two Clefs
		- [[Major Groove]]
			- deeper and wider than minor
			- Binds happen in major groove
		- [[Minor Groove]]
- 5' - 3'
- 3' - 5'
