Tissues are a collection of specialized cells that act as a unit
[[Sponges]] and other groups lack tissues
All other animals have two [[Germ Layers]]
[[Ectoderm]] covers the embryo's surface and gives rise to outer covering and central nervous system
[[Endoderm]] is the innermost layer that lines the blind pouch that will form the gut and gives rise to lining of the digestive tract
[[Diploblasty]] have [[Ectoderm]] and [[Endoderm]]
