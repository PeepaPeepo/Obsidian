# Molar Mass and Making Solutions

## What is molar mass?

- Molar mass is the weight of one mole of a specified element or compound.
- Is typically in grams per mole or g/mol or amu
- To determine the molar mass of a element in a compound, multiply the number of atoms of an element by the atomic mass number
- Regarding the number of atoms or molecules within a compound, [[Avogrado's Number]] must be used
- In an element there are $6.02*10^{23}$ atoms per mole
- In a molecule, there are $6.02*10^{23}$ molecules per mole
- The atomic mass is equal to molar mass in grams per mole

## Solution from a Dry Weight

When the molar mass of a compound is known, the amount of dry weight of the compound can be derived. Use the following forumla to make 100 mls of 50 mM solution of NaCl

$\ce{ [Volume in liters] * \frac{Concentration in Moles}{Liter} * \frac{Mol Weight of Comp}{Moles} = x grams }$

### To make the solution

- Add 0.922 g of NaCl to 85 mL of water, dissolve, then bring to 100 mL
- Do not fill container to final volume, especially for pH solutions
- Adding base of NaOh or HCl to solution to change pH will affect solution volume
- Liquid that is used to dissolve compound is the [[Solvent]]
- The compound being dissolved is called the [[Solubility]]
- When water is a solvent in a solution, it is identified as an aqueous solution abbreviated as $aq$

### Solution from Stock Concentration (Concentrations Percentages or Magnitude)

- Having accurate compound concentration is important in all applications of biological experiments
- Dry weight is not always possible, or a stock solution is already made 
- To make dilution from a stock concentration, the [[Dilution Formulas]] can be used
- Concentration C is equal to molarity of a substance
$$\ce{ C_{i}V_{i}=C_{f}V_{f} }$$
How would you prepare 200 mL of 1X TAE solution using 50X TAE Stock solution?

- 1X and 50X is the concentration of each respective buffer; they can substitute the variables '$C$' in the concentration formula
$$\ce{ 50V_{i} = 1*200 mL }$$
$$\ce{ V_{i} = \frac{200 mL}{50} }$$
$$\ce{ V_{i} = 4 mL}$$


What is [[Molarity]]?
