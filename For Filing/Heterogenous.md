- Heterogenous mixtures are unevenly distributed substances that are not chemically bonded 
- If a sample was collected there is an non-uniform ratio of substances
- Mixtures between multiple states of matter are almost always heterogenous
- Examples include sand and water
- There can be heterogenous mixtures of pure substances, but its safe to omit that idea and stick to homogenous mixtures
	- Examples include ice water, if collected a sample all the molecules would be the same
	- But it still meets the requirement of haven unevenly distributed samples
