# Nervous System

Network of nerve cells that transmit signals
Majority of cells are [[Neurons]] that transmit electrical and chemical signals
[[Glia]] protect Neurons
[[Astrocytes]] 
[[Central Nervous System]] is composed of [[Brain]] and [[Spine]]
[[Peripheral Nervous System]] everything else, also helps in functions of motor functions
Both cell types exist in the central and Peripheral Nervous System
Neurons in the gut
[[Enteric Nervous System]]

# Neurons

Parts of Neurons
Signaling cells of nervous system
Translate chemical to electrical signals
[[Cell Body]] has the [[Axon]] projecting out
[[Axon Hillock]] connects cell body to Axon
[[Axon Terminal]] connect to [[Dendrites]] of other [[Neurons]]
The connection of two neurons is known as a [[Synapse]]
[[Neurotransmitters]] chemical signal released from vesicles to the synapse releasted from Synapse
NMJ
[[Axon]] contain [[Schwann Cells]] that make up the [[Myelin Sheath]]
Membrane potential of Dendrite changes
Hillock has potential
mV ranges
A movement of ions within [[Axon Hillock]] and [[Action Potentials]]
Sodium Channel
[[Axonal Boutons]] Volt gated Ca Channel
Additive

[[Postsynaptic Neurons]] 
Glutatergic?
Gabamuteric acid?
Glutamate as a signaling 

# Central and Peripheral Nervous System

[[Central Nervous System]], receive information and integrate and coordinate responses
[[Spinal Cord]] is a bundle of neurons
[[Ganglia]] is a cluster of Neuron cell bodies
[[Nerves]] are bundles of [[Axon]] in the [[Peripheral Nervous System]]
	[[Sensory Neurons]] nerves that transmit sensory information
	[[Motor Neurons]] neurons that project from spine to stimulate effector organs
[[Interneurons]] transmits information between neurons, connect sensory and motor neurons 

# Resting Membrane Potentials

[[Resting Membrane Potentials]]
	Network of neurons
	Receives inputs from different signals
	[[Action Potentials]] as electrical systems
	Resting Potential
		Axon has many ions amongst the membrane
		Na/K Pumps
		Transport ions Ca in and Na out
		K channels are often open 
		Inside of neuron is negative
	Membrane has gated channels
		Closed at rest
		Stimulus opens it up
		Na goes inside the cell to create positive charge
		Potassium exits to reset
	[[Action Potentials]]
		Chain reaction and waves Na Channels
		Potash channels follow
	More sodium outside the nerve cells
	Spinal fluid 
Na/K Pump requires a lot of [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]
Excitatory signals such as glutamate
Receptors react to it around the synapse to help transfer Na/K
[[Cerebral Spinal Fluids]]
[[Blood Brain Barrier]] 

# Synaptic Transmissions

sending and receiving neurons through synapse
[[Synaptic Terminals]]
[[Synaptic Clefts]]
[[Neurotransmitters]] affect receiving neurons
[[Voltage Gated Calcium Channels]] causes vesicles to fuse, (SNARE Proteins)
Neuron contains more K than the transient Ca and Na
Effect of multiple synapses
Excitatory signals
Inhibitory signals
Glycine or GABA are inhibitory transmitters

# Glial Cells

Does not produce signals
Homeostasis function
Oligodendrocytes
[[Astrocytes]]
Ependymal cells
Microglia

Peripheral  Nervous System
	Schwann Cells
	Satellite Cells

[[Astrocytes]] maintains chemical enviornmet and formation of blood brain barrier
[[Oligodendrocytes]] [[Myelin]] Formation
[[Ependymal Cells]] lines spinal cord and ventricle portion of brain circulates CSF
	[[Neural Stem Cells]]
[[Microglial Cells]] are mesodermic
[[Hematopoietic Precursor Cells]] removes cellular debris, secretes signalling molecules such as [[Cytokines]], may be classified as a [[Microphage]]

[[Peripheral Nervous System]] 
	[[Schwann Cells]]
	[[Satellite Cells]]

# Astrocytes

[[Astrocytes]] what are they? 
	[[Glia]] brain glue
	Star shaped cells
	Creates more mass of brain
Contains [[Processes]] that connect to neurons
[[Buffers]] ion concentration within brain
Can communicate with [[Neurons]]
Synapse post, pre, and astrocytic process
Monitors signalling
Astrocyte can absorb excess glutamate
Ca waves can signal astrocytes
RGC + Astrocyte produces greater success
Thrombospones
Glypicans 4 and 7
recruit AMPA Receptors
Results in excitatory synapses
Sleeping leads to brain flushing out unwanted chemicals
Glymphatic System
