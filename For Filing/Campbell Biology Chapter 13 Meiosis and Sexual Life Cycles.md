Concept 13.2

[[Somatic Cells]] are [[Diploid]], 46 Chromosomes, 2 sets of 23
[[Homologs]] are [[Autosomes]]
[[Sex Chromosomes]]
[[Haploid]] [[Gametes]] through [[Meiosis]]
[[Fertilization]] forms a [[Diploid]] [[Zygotes]]

Concept 13.3

[[Meiosis I]] 
	[[Prophase I]]
		Each pair of homolog cross over to look like a Chiasmata
	[[Metaphase I]]
		Line Up
	[[Anaphase I]]
		Homologs separate with recombinants
[[Meiosis II]]
	Separates sister chromotids
Produce 4 haploid daughter cells
