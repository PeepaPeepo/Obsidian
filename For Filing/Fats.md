[[Fats]], also known as [[Fats|Triglycerides]] or [[Fats|Triacylglycerols]], are [[Lipids]] which are large [[Hydrophobic]] [[Organic Molecules]] and not true [[Polymers]]. Fats are composed of [[Glycerol|Glycerol]] joined to three [[Fatty Acids]]. 

The fatty acids of [[Fats|Triglyceride]] can be three of a kind, or two or three different kinds, and can form [[Unsaturated Fats]] or [[Saturated Fats]]. Fatty acids, depending on if it contains a double bonds in its carbon skeleton, can be determined as [[Saturated Fatty Acids]] or [[Unsaturated Fatty Acids]]. 

[[Unsaturated Fats]] can be be hydrogenated to convert it into a saturated fat called [[Trans Fats]]

Fats have twice the energy of [[Polysaccharides]], are stored as [[Adipose Cells]].
