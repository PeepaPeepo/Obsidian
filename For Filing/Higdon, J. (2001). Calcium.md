3. Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body, and it is found in bones and teeth, 1% of it is found in blood and soft tissue
3. Calcium has a narrow range of concentrations to work properly within extracellular fluid
4. Mineral component of bones and teeth Hydroxyapatite, $\ce{ Ca_{10}(PO_{4})6(OH_{2}) }$, stoichiometrically Calcium is the abundant constituent element in the the compound
4. Bone is a tissue that is remodeled frequently throughout life
4. Bone cells called osteoclasts begin remodeling by dissolving or resorbing bone
4. Osteoblasts synthesize new bone to replace the resorbed bones
4. Normal physiology has synthesis exceeding resorption, osteoporosis is the opposite 
4. A drop in blood Ca concentration is sensed by parathyroid glands and increases Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
4. PTH converts inactive Vitamin D into Active Vitamine D, 1,25 - Dihydroxyvitamin D, or Calcitriol. It decreases urinary exrection of Calcium, but increases excretion of phosphorous
4. PTH stimulates bone resorption that releases bone mineral
4. Increased calcitriol triggers intestinal abosrption of Ca and PO4
4. Active Vitamin D stimulates Ca release from bone by activating Osteocalsts like PTH
4. When homeostasis is achieved, PTH production is stopped
4. Increased blood calcium produces cacitonin from thyroid gland
4. Calcitonin inhibits PTH secreases to counter
