1. Both, Darwin's and Wallace's ideas about natural selection were inspired by their trips. Where did each of them travel and what did they observed, in general?

Both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace went on an expedition two different archipelago to study living organisms. Charles Darwin went on a voyage to the Bahia Blanca and the Galapagos Islands to study it's wildlife. The animals that were observed by Darwin were armadillos, iguanas, mocking birds, finches and other natural life. Wallace travelled to the Malay Archipelago to observe butterflies, monkeys, kangaroos, and the other natural occurring species. Both Darwin and Wallace observed that there were slight variance in traits of animals depending on the island they were found on.

Sailed on HMS Beagle
Amateur Naturalist
Examined plankton with a microscope during early voyage
09/1832 travelled to Bahia Blanca, Argentina
Found a Fossil Glyptodon similar to armodillo
09/15/1835 Travelled to Galapagos Islands (spanish colony)
He thought the iguanas were ugly
Tortoises were liked
Spanish told him that tortoise had different shell per island
Mockingbirds had subtle differences
	Smudge on breast
	Dark patch under Eye
	Pure White breast
Perhaps species came from main land but adapted to each island
Proposed that species might change
Species todays descend from extinct variations 
Evolution was against divine reasoning

[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] Specimen destroyed by ship fire
Specimen are from South America

Encounters Wallace who goes to Malay Archipelago, 14000 mile journey
Observed birdwing butterflies throughout archipelago
Amazon butterflies are different
The similar species live closer to each other
New law of nature, new species arise near similar species
Manatees have homologous morphologies 
Borneo monkey and orangetangs 
New Guinea have tree kangaroos
Marsupials vs non divided by wallace island
Hypothesized that it was original land mass that distrbuted species

How do species change?

Massive death plus variation
Variations with edge will survive and reproduce

Intense violent competition





2. What led to Darwin's and Wallace's conclusions that all species are connected in the tree of life?

Darwin and Wallace concluded that species are connected in the tree of life through fossil findings and observations of slight variation of species. After Darwin noticed the slight differentiation of finches and other life, he hypothesized that finches came from main land to the islands. They slowly changed generation through generation; he solidified that hypothesis with the observation of living armadillos and its relation to the ancestral fossil of a glyptodon. Wallace noticed there was a clear difference between tree dwelling creatures in the Malay archipelago as divided by the Wallace Line. That idea implied that tree dwelling marsupials may have descended from the Australian side. whereas the monkeys may have descended from Asia.

3. Which observations led Darwin and Wallace to understand how species change over time?

Wallace and Darwin had two different epiphanies about how species change over time. Wallace remembered Thomas Malthus and his concept that "human population are held in check by famine, disease and death", and applied it to animals. He overserved that species reproduce in large numbers, but only few survive because of certain traits. Darwin observed that animals had various traits depending on the island. He came up with the concept that species can give rise to new species. 

4. Even though both Darwin and Wallace formulated the natural selection theory at the same time, why do you think Wallace is not as recognized as Darwin for the theory of evolution?

Darwin's reputation may have influenced the outcome of why he's more recognized than Wallace. In the video, it shows that Darwin came from a richer family. With that much pedigree and wealth, one can speculate that they have that advantage against Wallace who was in a different class, but the video mentions that they were closer friends. Another theory is that because Darwin came up with the idea first, and that they both understand the competitive nature of natural selection they compromised and agreed for Darwin to get 'more' recognition.

6. In your own words, what is your understanding of natural selection?

Natural selection is the process in which individuals have higher survival and reproductive rates because of the traits they inherited. Most animals produce a significant rates for example: sea turtles spawn a lot of eggs, but when they hatch only few turtles make out to sea. Maybe those who are faster or more camouflaged gave them an edge of survival.
