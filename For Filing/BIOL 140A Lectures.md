	- [[Third Law of Thermodynamics]] 
		- [[Kinetic Energy]] of [[Atoms]] and [[Molecules]] is represented as temperature or heat
		- [[Absolute Zero]] is impossible elimination of movement of atoms and molecules
	- Second Law 
		- [[Entropy]] always increases over time
			- Physics a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system: the second law of thermodynamics says that entropy always increases with time | [count noun] :  the sum of the entropies of all the bodies taking part in the process. (Symbol: S)
		- Can never be negative in the universe
		- Can be in chemical reactions because of chemical equilibration

	- But can see back into it, looking at stars
	- One of the variable of aging

## Example

- Stack of hay has energy
- Horse eats it
- Horse poops
- Process can't go back wards

## Redox Reactions

- Processes of cells can only move forward
- [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Redox Reactions]]
	- [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions]]
	- Losing electrons are called Oxidations
	- Gaining electrons are Reductions
	- Loss of Hydrogen
	- [[Disulfide Bridges]] can be broken with reduction agents 
- Example of redox reaction
	- $\ce{ Fe_{2}O_{3} + 3CO -> 2Fe + 3CO_{2} }$
- Oxidation and Reaction are complimentary
- Food and Oxygen to energy plus water and CO2
	- Food Glucose is transformed into ATP and by product water

	- G - [[Gibbs Free Energy Change]]
	- Can't measure entropy well, but can measure the change of [[Gibbs Free Energy Change]]

$$\ce{ \Delta G = \Delta H -T\Delta S }$$

## Gibs Free Energy

Gibbs free energy is a measure of chemical energy.

All chemical systems tend naturally towards states of minimum Gibbs free energy

- $\Delta H$ (Change in Heat)
	- Exerting heat from a [[Systems]] is [[Exothermic Reactions]]
	- A [[Systems]] Absorbing Heat is [[Endothermic Reactions]]
- Reactions can be [[Exergonic Reactions]] which are spontaneous
	- Can happen on its own
	- Not fast or slow
	- No needed outside intervention 
- [[Endergonic Reactions]] is non spontaneous reactions
	- Not enough heat to cause reaction and addition of heat is required 

Products and reactants are in equilibrium when their Gibbs free energies are equal

A chemical reaction will proceed in the direction of lower Gibbs free energy $\ce{ \Delta Gr<0 }$
So the reaction wont proceed if the reaction produces an increase in Gibbs free energy

$\ce{ \Delta Gr=0 }$
$\ce{ \Delta Gr<0 }$
$\ce{ \Delta Gr>0 }$

$\ce{ \Delta G{f}>0 }$ = Free energy of formation 


- [[Enthalpy]] 
	- Spontaneity is favored when the process is exothermic deltaH<0
- Delta H and Delta S are the two driving forces of reactions
- DElta H < 0 and Delta S > 0 will have a spontaneous reaction
- $\ce{ \Delta H<0 }$

## Making Diamonds

- Graphite -> Diamonds
- 1700 K at 12 gigaPa
- DeltaG for both are similar

[[Gibbs Free Energy Change]] Chart

- Delta H < 0 and DElta S > 0

## ATP and Cellular Work 

[[Chemical Work]] - the pushing of endergonic reactions, which wouldn't ordrinally happen
[[Transport Work]]: Transporting molecules against their chemical gradient
[[Mechanical Work]]: Cillian and flagella moving things

ATP Release free energy, when phosphate bonds are hydrolyzed

DeltaG = -7.3kcal/mol 
$$\Delta G = \frac{-7.3kcal}{mol}$$

Reactions can be sped up with [[Catalysts]] such as [[Enzymatic Proteins]], and their names end with -ase.
Speeds up rates of reactions without being consumed. 

$$\ce{ [S] <=> [P] }$$
Reversible reaction until equilibrium happens, which equals death. 

$Concentration = [C]$
$Concentration of Substrate = [C]$

## Enzyme Catalyst

[[Free Enzymes]] + [[Free Substrates]] = E + S
[[Enzyme Substrate Complex]] = ES
[[Enzyme Product Complexes]] = EP
Free Enzyme + [[Free Products]] = E +P

# Lock and Key Fit

- Enzymes have pockets called [[Active Sites]] and has a bunch of [[Amino Acids]]
	- Active sites Typically polar, basic, and acid acids
		- They are geometric and allows substrates to bind well
		- Two thoughts of cause
			- [[Lock and Key Fit]]
				- Substrate has confirmation specific for active site
				- All amino acids will interact with the related amino acids of the active sites
				- Highly Specific
			- [[Induced Fit Theory]]
				- Not looking for exact fits, but similar fits
				- Some of the substrates can be [[ATP]]
				- [[ATPases]] are enzymes for ATP
			- Antibodies bonding to Antigens is specific
	- Holds on to substrates due to amino acid interactions
- And they fit together like a puzzle with specific molecules
- Structure equals functions

- Primer Templates and DNTP
- Sometimes there is one template

$\ce{ A<=>B<=>C<=>D<=>E }$

- A = Precursor
	- The first Reagent
		- E = End Product
- Precursor  binds substrate
- Substrate will enter active site
- Product B is temporary and becomes substrate for following step C
- No genes for amino acids
- Need several enzymes to make amino acids
- Other biochemical pathways can get to different steps of the process
- Taking out C will leave increase of C product
- How does [[Enzymes]] work
	- It speeds up reaction
	- It lowers the energy needed for reaction to go forward
	- $\ce{ E_{a} }$ = [[Free Energy of Activation]]
	- It is a endergonic reactions
	- Positive Delta G
- Reactants lower in concentration
- Enzymatic processes can be backwards or fowards until $\ce{ K_{eq} }$ Forward = Reverse 
- Enzymes lower energy of activation
	- Enzyme will bind with high affinity 
	- It changes it confirmation
	- Forces parts to interact

## dNTP Polymerization

$\ce{ E + DNA <=>[K_{1}][K_{-1}] E*DNA <=>[K_{2}][K_{-2}] E*DNA*dNTP <=>[K_{3}][K_{-3}] E^* * DNA*dNTP <=>[K4][K-4] E^* * DNA_{+1} * PP_{i} <=>[K5][K-5] E*DNA_{+1}*PP_{i} <=>[K_{6}][K_{-6}] E+DNA_{+1}}$
- Asterisks is the transition state, from substrate to product

## Catalysis

## Michaelis Menten Reactions

[[Michaelis Menten Kinetics]] occurs with substrate to product. $\ce{ [S] <=> [P] }$
There is a curve with these reactions. $V_{max}$ 
[[Saturation Points]] all active points are filled
Can only increase with addition of additional active sites

$\ce{ \frac{V_{max}}{2} }$ 

$\ce{ Km }$ is [[Michaelis Menten Constant]]
What does the relationship measure?
Km measures how well enzyme can bind substrate with high affinity and change in to product. It can change based on certain parameters.

Changing the [[Michaelis Menten Constant]], adding inhibitors change constant. [[Competitive Inhibitors]] creates competition for [[Active Sites]]. 


Interferes with active site of enzyme so substrate cannot bind.
[[Noncompetitive Inhibitors]] changes shape of enzyme so it cannot bind to substrate

==[[Allosteric Regulation]] changes geometry of [[Active Sites]] to prevent binding

Relative to regular enzyme function
[[Competitive Inhibitors]] have same $\ce{ V_{max} }$ and different $\ce{ K_{m} }$
[[Noncompetitive Inhibitors]] have same $\ce{ K_{m}}$ and different $\ce{ V_{max} }$

## Cooperativity

There are 20 amino acids
The four bases

[[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]]

# Cal State East Bay 2 Recording from Martha

[[Glycolysis]] gets two [[Pyruvate]] 
[[Pyruvate]] injects into [[Mitochondria]] using 2 [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]]
[[Pre-Citric Acid Cycle]] creates converts [[Pyruvate]] to [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]]
[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] becomes [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]]
It makes a waste product, CO_2
Takes two oxygens from pyruvate
CO2 exchanges with O2 from Red Blood cells
[[Oxaloacetate]] is the first step of the krebs cycle

## Formation of Citrate

[[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]] gets condesed with [[Oxaloacetate]] to form [[Citrate]] and its catalyzed by [[Citrate Synthase]]
[[Coenzyme A]] gets recycled

[[Alpha-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase]] catalyzes NAD+ oxidation to NADH

## Conversion of Succinyl-CoA to Succinate

[[Coenzyme A|CoA]] is removed from [[Succinyl-Coenzyme A]] to produce [[Succinate]]

[[Succinyl-Coenzyme A Synthase]] is the catalyst

[[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FAD]] is like [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]]

## Oxidation of Succinate to Fumarate

[[Succinate]] is oxidized to [[Fumarate]] and [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FAD]] is reduced to [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH2]]
This is catalyzed by [[Succinate Dehydrogenase]] removes two hydrogen from succinate

## Hydration of Fumarate to Malate

Reversible hydration of fumarate to L-Malate is catalyzed by [[Fumarate Hydratase]] H_2O is added to fumarate to make [[Malate]]

## Oxidation of Malate to Oxaloacetate
