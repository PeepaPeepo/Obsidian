[[Complete Ionic Equations]] breaks up compounds into their individual [[Cations]] and [[Anions]] with proper quantities to form neutrally charged compounds. 

Only [[Aqueous Solutions|Aqueous]] Ionic Solutions are separated in these equations. [[Liquids]], [[Solids]], and [[Gases]] can be separated. 

[[Complete Ionic Equations]] can be converted to [[Net Ionic Equations]] by removing the [[Spectator Ions]].
