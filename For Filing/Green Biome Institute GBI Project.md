# Introduction

Preparation of Lilium Candidum for a [[DNA Sequencing Library]] will be conducted through the standard procedure of DNA Isolation, Adapter Ligation, Nick-Repair, and Purification of Ligated DNA, and Gel Electrophoresis. 



[[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] samples will be frozen until next session.

[[Agarose Gel Electrophoresis]] will be performed with plant DNA. and a DNA Smear of high mwm will be good for [[PCR]]

Third way will check plant dna concentration and purity and PCR will be carried out.

Fourthday will be agarose gel plate on amplified dna, 1300 bp band of DNA is good.

Two gels, one before and after PCR.

## Part 3C: Adapter Ligation, Nick-Repair, and Purification of Ligated DNA (Thermo Fisher, 2016) 

Acquired 0.2 mL PCR Tube and using a p200 added 20 uL genomic DNA, "Unknown Sample M.C.", and 5 uL of Adapter Ligation Reagents (ligase buffer, adapters, dNTP mix) nuclease-free water, DNA ligase, and nick repair polymerase). Labelled tube with "PC"

Placed labelled PCR tube into a Thermo Cycler machine with the the following Parameters. 
  
### Thermo cycler Conditions for Incubation (Green Biome Institute Project)

| **Function** | **Temperature** | **Time**   | **Cycles** |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Hold         | 25 °C           | 15 minutes | 1          |
| Hold         | 72 °C           | 5 minutes  | 1          |
| Hold         | 4 °C            | ∞          | 1          |

After completion of thermo cycler, transferred Adapter Ligation Sample to new 1.5 mL Microcentrifuge Tube labelled "PC".  

Added 30 uL of AgencourtTMAMPureTM XP bead suspension to 25 uL of ligation sample.
Transferred new mixture to centrifuge at 6.0 x g for 5 minutes. Placed tube in to Sergi Lab Supplies Magnetic Rack for 3 minutes. Using a p200, discarded supernatant while avoiding bead pellet.

Calculated a 70% Ethanol Solution using the following dilution equation:

$$\ce{ 1.0V_{1} = 0.70(500 uL) }$$

Added 350 uL of 100% Ethanol to 150 uL distilled water to create 70% Ethanol Solution.

With the tube still attached to the magnet, transferred 500 μL of freshly prepared 70% ethanol into your sample. Incubated the tube for 30 seconds and inverted the tube three to four times throughout. Once the solution presented clear, removed supernatant with p1000 while avoiding cell bead pellet.

Re-added 350 uL of 100% Ethanol to 150 uL distilled water to create 70% Ethanol Solution.

With the tube still attached to the magnet, transferred 500 μL of freshly prepared 70% ethanol into your sample. Incubated the tube for 30 seconds and inverted the tube three to four times throughout. Once the solution presented clear, removed supernatant with p1000 while avoiding cell bead pellet.

Centrifuged sample at 10.0 x g for 1 minute to remove excess ethanol. Placed it back into the magnetic rack and Using a p20 micropipette, discarded the supernatant without provoking the bead pellet.

With the tube still attached to the magnet, air‐dry the beads at room temperature (RT) for 5 minutes.

Removed the tube from the magnetic rack and transferred 20 μL of Low TE directly to the pellet to scatter the beads. Mixed with pipette and vortex for 10 seconds.

Centrifuged sample at 10.0 x g for 1 minute the sample and then returned the tube to the magnetic rack for at least 1 minute. Once the solution presented as clear, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube without disturbing the pellet. Labelled as "PC PURE PLANT MC SAMPLE 10/31/23"

Submitted to Jennifer L to freeze the _labeled_ tube at -20 °C.

## Part 4A: Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Amplified Plant DNA Samples (after PCR)  

Measured out 0.5 grams of agarose powder and added 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask along with 50 mL of stock 1X TAE Buffer to make a 1% solution. Microwaved for 60 seconds and swirled every 30 seconds, added 3 uL of GelRed and mixed.

Assembled casting tray and poured GelRed Agarose Gel Solution to about 0.5 cm thickness. After gel solidified, removed barriers, poured 1X TAE to each reservoir until Max level reached, then removed gel comb.  

Using a p20 micropipette, added 5 μL of loading dye and 5 μL of plant PCR sample to a piece of Parafilm and mixed with pipette.

Using a p20 micropipette, added 5 μL of loading dye and 5 μL of Adapter Ligation Sample to a piece of Parafilm and mixed with pipette.

Onto a fresh piece of Parafilm, combined 5 μL of molecular weight marker (MWM) + 2 μL of loading dye (LD) + 3 μL of 1X TAE.  

Using a new p20 micropipette for each sample, transferred 10 uL of each sample from left to right: MWM, ==PCR DNA==, Adapter Ligation DNA.

%% PCR DNA was dispersed on para film, Adapter ligation was using a random sample, would check with Maya to see. %%

Ran the gel for ~45 minutes at 100 Volts.

Took a photograph of the agarose gel (via ChemiDoc and Image Lab software), and documented with Pixel 7a on automatic settings.
