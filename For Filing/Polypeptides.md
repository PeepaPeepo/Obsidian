[[Polypeptides]] are [[Polymers]] of [[Proteins]] that are made up of at least twenty [[Amino Acids|Amino Acid]] [[Monomers]] joined together by [[Peptide Bonds]]. 

Backbones of [[Polypeptides]] consists of an [[Amino Group]], [[Side Chains|Side Chain]], and [[Carboxyl Groups]] connected to a [[Asymmetric Carbons|Asymmetric Carbon]] called an $\alpha$ carbon; this is called [[Polypeptide Backbones]].

The side chains determine the amino acid identity, and the sequences of the acids can range from a few to a thousand. Each end of the polypeptide contain an [[N-Terminus]] and [[C-Terminus]]. 

A polypeptide by itself is not a protein until its shaped into a functional protein.
