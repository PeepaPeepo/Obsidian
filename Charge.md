Charge is represented as $q$ or $Q$, and the SI unit of charge is the [[Coulomb]], $C$.

[[Electrons]] and [[Protons]] are the basic charges in matter. Electrons and Protons are different in mass, but equal in [[Magnitude]] of charge.

Objects are only charged when there is an unequal number of protons and electrons.
