# Orthographic vs Perspective Views 

[[Orthographic]] representation of objects in this section renders objects so that dimensions can be shown clearly, this occurs within engineering and architecture.
[[Perspective]] is a real world process of perceiving objects where edges point towards a vanishing point.

## Questions

What are the two types of views mentioned when it comes to perspective section of DAT?
What are the main differences and functions?

# What does this mean to you?

The keyholes in this section must also be the appropriate size, although some objects could fit in a square, it must be large enough to accommodate the shape.
Edges that are measured on the 3d object then compared to the correct answer will not be the same due to perspective, focusing on the proportion is the most important aspect.
Drawing out the side profiles would be a good approach to this section.

# Approaching Keyhole Questions

One of the methods that can applied for this section is the following:

1. Imaging how the image would look orthographically from three different positional views like the figure above.
2. Look for the answer you are most sure of, BUT look for any irregularities
3. Eliminate problems moving forward
4. If there are similar answers, spot the differences
5. if one is more doable, then look at the scaling and proportions

# Question Bank Notes

30 . Picked to too large of a keyhole, second guessed the correct one because it doesn't look visually the same size when converting from perspective. It looked larger.

31 . Correct shape looks way smaller than I thought
