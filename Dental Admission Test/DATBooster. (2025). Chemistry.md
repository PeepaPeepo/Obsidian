# 2 Introduction to the Periodic Table

[[Element Groups]] are [[Elements]] in the [[Periodic Table of the Elements]] that are in the same column. Those elements have the same number of [[Valence Electrons]].

[[Periods]] are elements that occupy the same row, and they have the same amount of [[Electron Shells]].

[[Atomic Number]] indicates how many protons that element has.

[[Alkali Metals|Group 1A]] are alkali metals
[[Alkaline Earth Metals|Group 2A]] are alkaline earth metals
[[Transition Elements|Transition Metals]] are groups from 3 - 12
[[Halogens]] are group 17
and Group 18 are [[Noble Gases]]
[[Oxidation Numbers|Oxidation States]] indicates the number of electrons it gains or loses when bonding with atom.
Transitions metals have multiple oxidation states.
[[Inner Transition Metals]] are periods 6 and 7
Period six metals are [[Lanthanides]]
Period 7 are [[Actinides]]
Inner transition metals are not abundant compared to transition metals.

[[Transition Elements|Transition Metals]] have [[Valence Electrons]] in [[d-orbital]]

# Chapter 3 Atomic and Molecular Structure

## 1 Introduction to Atoms and Subatomic Particles

[[Dalton's Atomic Theory]] states that all matter is made of [[Atoms]], atoms of the same element has the same mass and properties, compounds are made of whole number ratios of two or more, a chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms.

[[Subatomic Particles]] are what make up an atom, [[Neutrons]], [[Protons]], and [[Electrons]].
The mass of [[Protons]] is an [[Atomic Mass Units|amu]].
The atomic number of an atom is the number of [[Protons]] an element contains.
The [[Mass Numbers]] are the sums of [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]] in [[Elements]]
[[Core Electrons]] are any electron that is not the [[Valence Electrons]], which are the electrons in the most outer shell.
The maximum number of electrons per level is $2n^2$

[[Atomic Notation]] $\ce{ ^A_{Z}X }$, mass is the upper left, A, and Z is the atomic number, Z.
Changing the number of neutrons changes the [[Isotopes|Isotope]] of an element.
[[Atomic Masses]] are calculated by taking a weighted average of naturally occurring isotopes and respective abundances.
Removing or adding electrons will form [[Ions]]

## 2 Types of Reactions

[[Law of Constant Composition]] elements within a compound always combine in fixed proportions.
[[Physical Reaction]] molecules undergo rearrangement to produce a physical change; the notes say that it includes changes that make substances dense or not.
[[Chemical Reactions]] involve substances undergoing a change that produces a new chemical, this maybe defined as any interaction that makes or breaks bonds.

Type of reactions can include: [[Synthesis Reactions]], [[Decomposition Reactions]], [[Single-Displacement Reactions]], [[Double Displacement Reactions]], [[Combustion Reactions]]
[[Synthesis Reactions]] is the creation of substance from smaller units
[[Single-Displacement Reactions]] replaces one element in a molecule
[[Double Displacement Reactions]] exchanges bonds between two species, and these in include [[Acid-Base Reactions|Neutralization Reactions]], and [[Precipitation Reactions]].
[[Combustion Reactions]] is any reaction that includes $O_{2}$ and produces light and heat.
Combustion of hydrogen and oxygen makes water
Hydrocarbon Combustions make water and $CO_{2}$

## 3 Quantum Theory 

[[Bohr Model]] is an outdated model of Atom
[[Quantum Theory]] states that electrons are found in orbitals 
[[Quantum Numbers]] describe the possible location and energy of an atom's electron, and its unique to each electron of an atom
[[Dalton's Atomic Theory|Atomic Theory]] have four main values that describe an [[Electrons]]
[[Principal Quantum Numbers]] is the shell number, n
[[Azimuthal Quantum Number]] describes the shape of the subshells ,or [[Orbital Shape]]
I = 0 is s, I = 2 is d
[[Magnetic Quantum Number]] describes the orientation of the orbitals in space
[[Spin Quantum Number]] describes angular momentum of electron as halves
[[Pauli's Exclusion Principle]] says electrons cannot have the same address

### Questions

What does [[Magnetic Quantum Number]] ($m_l$) describe?
What values are allow or correlated with integers from -1 to +1
How can you determine the limit of electrons that be held at a specific energy level? $2n^2$ rule.
What is an [[Azimuthal Quantum Number]]? It is the number assigned to describe the orbital shape.
What numbers are allowed to be assigned to [[Azimuthal Quantum Number]]? It accepts integers from 0 to (n-1).


## 4 Electron Configuration

Subshells have different number of orbitals, s has 1, p has 3, d has 5, and f has 7.
Each orbital can hold two electrons each.

[[Electron Configurations]] shows how many electrons are in each energy level.
The notation is shown as n orbital electron
$2p^6$ refers to principle shell 2, orbital p, and contains 6 electrons.
[[Noble Gas Core Notations]] simplifies notation so that the entire configuration doesn't have to be written out.
[[Aufbau Principle]] states that subshells get filled from lowest to highest
[[Hund's Rule]] basically states that you have to 'deal out' the electron arrows instead of pairing them from the get go
Some exceptions to full or half full configurations in clude chromium and copper
Ions can be also notated in configuration, just remove or add the appropriate number of ions
[[Isoelectronic Species]] are ions and atoms that have the same configuration

Precision is really when measurements are around -/+ 1 ofg each other 

[[Significant Figures]]
[[Systematic Error]] is consistent shifts in one direction of a measurement caused by equipment or procedural error 
[[Random Error]] varies in either direction and can be cause by human limitations, like how meniscus can be seen at different angles
[[Percent Error]] is the experimental value 

# Chapter 6 Gases 

## 6.1 General Properties of Gases

Gas molecules have no size or shape and move in random constant motion
Diatomic gasses are elements that come in Pairs, Have No Fear Of Ice **C**o**l**d Beer
Properties that affect gas behaviors such as Temperature, Volume, Pressure
Pressure is the force of gas particles colliding with the walls
Pressure equals F/Area
When gasses expand then the have less pressure

### Summary

Gases are a state of matter that has no definite shape or volume, and takes it from the container that they are in.
Diatomic gases are elements that come in pairs and exist as naturally as gas.
The three properties that affect gas are temperature, volume, and pressure
Compression leads to increased pressure and temperature, and small volume
Expansion leads to decreased pressure, temperature, and larger volume

## 6.2 Gas Laws

==These laws must be memorized== 
- [[Boyle’s Law]]
- [[Charles’s Law]]
- [[Avogrado's Law]]
- [[Gay-Lussac's Law]]

# 7 Liquids and Solids

## 7.1 Intermolecular Forces

Intermolecular forces are interactions between neighboring molecules and it determines physical properties of the matter it makes.

[[London Dispersion Forces]] focuses on temporary dipoles, bigger molecules have greater london dispersion forces.
[[Dipole Moments|Dipole-Dipole Forces]] are interactions with fixed dipoles, this relies on asymmetric geometry
[[Hydrogen Bonds]] only occurs with H bonded to ON or F
[[Molecular Geometry]] should account for lone pairs that could affect overall molecular shape
Dipoles only work if there's a net dipole moment
Boiling points are based on the strength of IMF
Ranking structures depend on their IMF
London Dispersion for unbranched molecules have higher forces because of lack of steric hinderance
Boiling is the process of breaking IMF
[[Ionic Bonds]] are not covalent or IMFS
[[Intramolecular Forces]] refer to Polar/Nonpolar [[Covalent Bonds]], [[Ionic Bonds]], [[Metallic Bonds]]
Polarity of covalent bonds depend on the difference of electronegativity of two atoms of a molecule
[[Ionic Bonds]] are bonds of metal and non metal atoms with a complete transfer of electrons
Read questions carefully.

## 7.2 Phase Changes

Three states of matters are [[Solids]], [[Liquids]], and [[Gases]]
Any substances can change into each state, and they are all physical changes
[[Endothermy|Endotherm]] changes require heat
[[Exothermic Reactions]] release energy
==Change from solid to liquid is [[Heat of Fusion]]== Fusion sounds misleading.
[[Crystallization]] is the transition from liquid to solid, also known as freezing
Liquid to gas is [[Vaporization]]
Gas to liquid is [[Condensation]]
[[Sublimation]] is a solid turning into a gas
[[Deposition]] is from gas to solid

## 7.3 Entropy and Enthalpy

[[Entropy]] correlates to disorder or randomness, and is represented as $\Delta S$, where higher S is more disorder
[[Enthalpy]] is amount of heat gained or lost
If H is greater than zero, then its taking it heat
If it was lower, its releasing heat or [[Exothermic Reactions]]. 
H is relative to system.
Heat of vaporization is greater than heat of fusion, it takes more heat to vaporize something than to melting something.
This means that it takes even more heat to break the remaining IMF
Heat of sublimation is greater than heat of vaporization, it takes a great amount of heat to sublime something than to vaporize it.
Enthalpy change of one mole of a substance in standard state 

==Standard Enthalpy of Formation==

$$\Delta H^0_{Reaction}=\Sigma n*\Delta H^0_{f(products)}-\Sigma m*\Delta H^0_{f(reactants)}$$

Two qualities, makes one mole.
1. Look at each individual product and reactant and check if they are in standard state
2. Multiply heats of fusion by number of respective moles and plug into equation

### Practice Question

What is the correct equation for heat of formation $\Delta H^0_{f}$ for NaCl (s)?

Answer: $\ce{ Na(s) + \frac{1}{2} Cl_{2} }(g) \to NaCl(s)$

[[Heats of Formation]] problems are addressed with [[Standard Enthalpy of Formation]].
1. Reactions should represent products as **1 mole**
2. Standard states of reactants must be identified. Are Na and Cl naturally gasses or solids?
3. The equation is formed
4. The equation has to be balanced properly so the result is 1 mole of product, so you can use fractions to balance the sides

## 7.4 Phase Diagrams

[[Condensation]] of a vapor leads to a 

## 7.5 Properties of Liquids and Solids

Liquids take shape of containers
They are uncompressible
They are held together with IMF
[[Solubility]] and [[Miscibility]] are characterisitcs of liquids
Solubility is the degree a solute can be dissolved in a solvent
Miscibility is the degree that two liquids can mix
Viscosity is the thickness of a liquid, it can be decreased with higher temperature
[[Surface Tension]] is the ability that a liquid surface to resist external forces, increasing temp breaks it
Vapor Pressure is the equilibirum pressure exterted by a vpaor above its liquid in a closed system

# 8 Thermochemistry & Thermodynamics

## 8.1 First Law of Thermodynamics & Enthalpy

[[Law of Conservation of Energy]] nothing is destroyed or created
System + Surroudings = Universe
System is teh checmial reaction
Surrounding is the container that reaction was happening
Ice cube is the System
Surroundings is hand and atmosphere
==[[Enthalpy]] is the amount of heat energy IN a system==
==$\Delta H=H_{products}-H_{\mathrm{Re}ac\tan ts}$==
Exothermic reactions decrease entropy

Endothermic Reactions have a Delta H greater than 0
Three heat transfes is [[Conduction]], [[Convection]], and [[Radiation]]
Convection is a circulation of a substance

### Summary

- [[Law of Conservation of Energy]] states that all energy is neither created or destroyed
- [[Systems]] are subjects of observation and interact with [[Surroundings]], the two of them together makes a [[Universe]]
- [[Enthalpy]] is the total heat of a system where its the heat of products - reactants
- [[Exothermic Reactions]] release heat, [[Endothermy|Endothermic]] reactions take in heat
- Three ways to transfer heat is [[Convection]], [[Conduction]], and [[Radiation]]

## 8.2 Heat Transfers and Work

[[Work]] is change in internal energy = q + w
w = -PDelta V
Positive Work and Negative Work
The context is the surrounding is doing work on system or the other way around
[[Work-Heat Equations]]
Enthalpy +q = endothermic
Heat +w = compression
$\Delta E=q+w$

## 8.3 Specific Heat Capacity and Calorimetry

[[Specific Heat Capacity]] is the amount of energy to raise temperature of 1 gram of substance by 1 degree Celsius 
Specific heat capacity is different per state of matter of a substance
$q=mC\Delta T$
Heat of Fusion and Vaporation is another accounting for energy required for transtion state
$q=m\Delta H$ and units are in kg
[[Phase Change Diagrams]]
[[Bomb Calorimetry]] is $q_{rxn}=-q_{cal}$

## 8.4 Calculating Enthalpy

Calculate bond forming and breaking
Formations 
[[Hess's Law]]
Important to understand the formation and destruction of bonding
Breaking bonds is an [[Endothermy|Endothermic]] process
Bonds like to be made
$$\Delta H^0_{rxn} = \Sigma\Delta H^0_{bonds\ broken} - \Sigma\Delta H^0_{bonds formed}$$
==The approach for these problems is based on identifying bonds between atoms and using them in relation to their bond energies==

Standard State Elements are zero

[[Hess's Law]] its like a vector sum of of heats.

## 8.5 Entropy

[[Entropy]] describes the amount of disorder of a system, represented as S
High entropy is typically more stable or natural
Heat increases entropy
mole entropries minus reactan mole entropies
Entropy increases from solids to gas
Dissolved items is an increase of entropy
Temperature increase entropy because it is shaken and can be anywhere
Total number of molecules increase entropy

The bigger the S, the greater the Entropy
Entropy = S

## 8.6 Spontaneity of Chemical Reaction

[[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] reactions occur without extra input of energy
All spontaneous reactions increase entropy of the universe 
[[Gibbs Free Energy Change]] $\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S$ determines if spontaneous or nonspontaneous
Sponeantous reactions relate the position of reactants and prodcuts o nreacio ncoordinate
