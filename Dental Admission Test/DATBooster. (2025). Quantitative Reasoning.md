## 1.3 Conventions of Quantitative Reasoning

Real numbers are intergers, ratioanl, irrational
LCM is least common multiple
Greatest common Factor

# Algebra Part 1

## 2.1 Real Numbers and Integers

## 2.2 Order of Operations

## 2.3 Prime Numbers

Prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and itself
So two factors in total
1 Is not a prime number
Under 20 includes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
2 Is the only even prime number
Listing prime numbers between a range can be done by listing out all the numbers and removing any value that are even and divisible by 5, then it can be tested. Look for numbers only divisible by 2 factors.

All Composite factors can be written as a product of prime numbers

Composite numbers can be written as product of prime numbers
so check if something is divisible by 2 or 3, or any other prime numbers, then keep dividing by possible prime factors

## 2.11 Decimals

Naming decimals and operations with decimals
Adding decimals need to align decimals to properly perform addition and subtraction operations
Multiplication and division is performed ignoring the decimal places, then move it x amount of places from the other
Division requires shifting decimals for both values
Zeros in divisions can be canceled to make processes easier

## 2.12 Ratios and Proportions

Ratios are ordered sets of numbers that show a relation between two or more things

### Ratios Example 2

The ratio of books in room a, b, and c is 3:4:5. If all three rooms have 2,400 books combined, how many books does room C have?

#### Approach

The ratio can be summed into a total of 12
Room C is 5 of the total sum
Now the conversion factor is essentially 5/12

### Ratios Example 3

If A = 4x - 15 and B = x + 3 and the ratio of A to B is 5:2 what is the value of A?

#### Approach

A:B is a valid ratio
A and B is given and can be substituted
A to B is 5:2
Make the expressions a ratio and set it equal to 5:2

## 2.13 Scientific Notation

Method of expressing numbers as 'convenient' decimal form
Always have 1 digit on the left the decimal
x10 describes how many places to move

## 2.14 Arithmetic Sequences

Find numbers in a sequence and the sum of something
Ordered set with common difference between terms
Positive common difference is the difference between each term

$$a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)*d$$

Arithmetic Progression
Sum of Arithmetic Sequence

$S_{n}=n\left( \frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2} \right)$

# 3 Algebra Part 2

## 3.1 Algebraic Expression

Matehmatic statemetns compsoed of variables, constants, and operations
Coefficients are numbers that are multiplied by variables
Constants dont change
Terms can be a variable alone, constant alone, or cobination of 

Expressions are categorized by number of terms
Monomial
Binomial
Trinonmia
Polynomal is all of them

Degree is the highest power
Linear expressions have highest power of 1
Quadraditc is power of 2
Cubic is highest degree of 3

Varaibles as demoniator is not expresion

## 3.2 Fractions with Variables

Find the [[Common Denominator]]
Find the base with highest power

==Fractional equations==

## 3.3 Factoring and Solving Polynomials 

[[Factor]] is a number that divides evenly into a value

## 3.6 Functions

A relates an out put with a given input
Composition of Functions where you put a function in a function
f(x) basically indicates that you can replace x with an input then apply it to a function
[[Stepwise Functions]] contains all constant functions
either open circules on graphs, with greater less than range
 Intersection of functions can be found by setting each function equal to each other, plug in x to the functions

## 3.7 Linear Equations

Represents graph of straight line, highest degree is 1
Y= mx + b

# 6 Statistics and Data Analysis

## 6.1 Mean-Median-Mode-Range

[[Mean]] is the sum of the values divided by number of values.
[[Median]] of a range is is the value in the middle of an odd set, if there is two in the middle then its the average of the two center numbers.
[[Mode]] are values that occur the most often, and can include multiples if there is an equal amount
[[Range]] is maximum number minus lowest number
