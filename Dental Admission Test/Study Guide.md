# Phase 2: Practice Questions/Tests & Review 
22
 With your first phase complete, you will now begin a general review process of the content you have learned. Keep in mind, the content in this phase is not meant to be a thorough review, it’s meant to be a general review. Remember, the key is to focus on breadth over depth. Using tools such as Anki decks or Quizlet flashcards will be crucial to master specific subjects like Biology. Furthermore, there will be more frequent practice tests, which are to be taken under TIMED conditions. While completing these full-length tests, you will also continue your revision of content so your foundation stays strong. When you are reviewing topics which are difficult for you, review using your notes, videos, and formula/reaction sheets (if appropriate).  
 Biology Pro-Tip:  
• BIO BITS: This is simply an additional tool to help you memorize content, and are completely 
optional. Additionally, do not worry about completing the questions, as you will be able to 
continue working on these questions in phase 3.

Congratulations! 
Your practice/review phase is now complete.

Phase 3: Practice Test & Filling in Gaps 
31
 With your second phase complete, you will now transition into filling in gaps of knowledge and 
mastering content. The remaining practice tests are most representative and will truly gauge where you 
stand before taking the DAT. As you make mistakes or encounter material you do not understand or 
recognize, review it in order to prevent future errors. Review each test after you complete that specific 
test. Note: It is critical to keep in mind that practice tests may not always accurately predict your score 
on the exam. The purpose of practice tests is to identify weak areas in knowledge and prepare you for 
the duration and speed necessary to complete the exam on time. Use your practice results to guide how 
you prepare for the test.

which require stamina. 
Day #85 – Test Day 
If you got this far, don’t worry you got this! Just stay calm and collective on the day of the DAT, and 
keep your eyes on the goal ☺. Below are a few final tips before taking the DAT:  
• Biology, Chemistry, Organic Chemistry - Depending on the version of the exam you get, the 
ADA may make one of these sections brutal (either heavy on calculations for chemistry or odd

 biology questions no one can see coming). Keep this in mind and if you’re stuck on a question, 
move on and come back to it at the end if you have time.  
• Perceptual Ability - This section varies exam to exam based on the version you get, so be on 
your toes. Some versions you may see a ton of rock keyhole questions and in other years, you’ll 
see none. 
• Reading Comprehension - There is almost always a passage that throws students off every cycle 
due to its difficulty or the odd number of questions associated with it. For example, in one cycle 
the ADA had 12 questions for the 1st passage. So manage your time wisely. 
• Quantitive Reasoning - The questions you will encounter will be simpler than what DATBooster 
contains. If you are able to get through the questions on DATBooster, you should be able to 
breeze through the questions on the real exam. 
• Everything will be given to you on the day of the actual DAT (pencil, paper, eraser). 
• Bring a snack with you to replenish your energy during breaks. 
• Get enough sleep, you’ll need as much energy as possible for sections. 
• If you get stuck on a question, choose the BEST answer and move on. 
IMPORTANT: From time to time, the ADA will add a few new questions that might be covered in ANY 
resource OR even make the Reading Comprehension section very dense. If this happens, do NOT be 
alarmed! The ADA usually does this to try new things and will likely not use those questions to evaluate 
your performance. Also, keep in mind everyone will be in the same boat as you, so remain calm and 
collected, and simply choose the best answer. ☺
