# Introduction

This section provides 2/3 views: top, front, or end.
The views are directly parallel to x, y, and z axis and invisible or hidden lines are represented behind the face.
The goal is the pick the pattern that completes the set.

# Approaching top-front-end questions

1. Scan both orthographic projection and get a rough idea of what the object could be
2. Find the differentiating factors in similar answer choices, then compare
3. Eliminate answers that contradict the projects
4. Repeat 2 and 3 until strong answer appears

**Step 1: Scan both of the two orthographic projections and answer choices to gain the rough idea of what the structure could be.**

Don't even worry about which one is right, tunnel visioning on the two doesn't help render a 3d object.

**Step 2: Find the differentiating factor in similar answer choices and check these differences by analyzing the orthographic projections given**

This person picked two options because they are similar, then they looked for differences

**Step 3: Eliminate the answer options that contradict projects**

**Step 4: Repeating steps 2 and 3 until correct** 

This person notes that if you find a contradiction, then any other projection with that problem is easily eliminated.

1. Scan the two givens and provided answers to get the 3d image in brain
2. Pick two similar answers and pick out the problems
3. Repeat
