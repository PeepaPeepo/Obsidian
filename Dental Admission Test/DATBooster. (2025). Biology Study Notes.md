## 1.1 Introduction

Key ideas are to **memorize**, **use active learning**, and **implement spaced repetition**. 
The test can ask any question throughout the survey.
**Active Learning** is activated via questions and force recall by trying to recite what notes were just taken.
**Spaced Repetition** means to come back and review content.

### Don't

1. Skip learning phase of content review
2. Don't do all bio bit question, just focus on weaknesses
3. Don't leave biology for the last second
4. Get discouraged by low scores
5. Don't forget number one predictor of success which is amount of effort put in

# Cells and Organelles (5)

### 2.8 Cell Theory

[[Cells]] are the smallest organizational unit of life, and a collection of cells with similar function form [[Tissues]]. Cells make up [[Eukarya|Eukaryotes]] and [[Prokaryotes]].

[[Cell Theory]] states the following:
1. [[Organisms]] are made of at least one or more cells
2. The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization
3. Cells come from existing cells
4. Activity of an organism depends on the net activity of all individual cells
5. Energy flows through cells 
6. Cells contain genetic formation that is passed through division or creation of off springs
7. Cells of similar species have same basic composition

Common categories of organisms are [[Unicellular Organisms|Unicellular]] or [[Multicellular Organisms|Multicellular]]. 

==Essential parts of a cell include [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]], [[Plasma Membranes]], and [[Ribosomes]]==. The bare bones setup is DNA for instructions to form, a container, and ribosomes that work or synthesize.

The only cell types that exists are [[Prokaryotes]] and [[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] (Eu "YOU" are made of eukaryotic cells)

[[Prokaryotes]] are the simple ones, lack of nucleus and no organelles.
[[Eukarya|Eukaryotes]] are complex and have what the prokaryotes don't have

### 3.2 Cell Membrane and Permeability

[[Plasma Membranes]] are made of a [[Phospholipid Bilayer]], [[Phospholipids]] are type of [[Macromolecules]] [[Lipids]]. The basic composition is a polar phosphate head, and non polar fatty acid tails. Nonpolar fatty acid link up with the phosphate heads facing towards the cytoplasm or the apical side. 

==[[Phospholipids]] are [[Amphipathic]].==

Plasma membranes have proteins and cholesterols embedded in them, thus the name [[Fluid Mosaic Model]], fluidity comes from the fact that everything is not fixed in place.

Function is to separate environments of inside and outside of cell, communication, structural support and protection.

Only few things are allowed to diffuse through membrane without extra help. Small and non polar and polar molecules. 

### 3.3 Organelles and Cell Structure

[[Organelles]] are ==membrane-bound== structures with specialized functions.

[[Cell Nucleus]] contains DNA which controls gene expression. It is composed of a nuclear envelope which is a double membrane structure with pores to let molecules in and out.

The Nuclear Lamina is like a structural support that maintains the shape of the nucleus.

==The nucleolus is where [[Messenger Ribonucleic Acid|mRNA]] is made. [[Ribosomal Proteins]] are imported from [[Cytoplasm]] into the nucleolus, then it is combined with mRNA to make [[Ribosomal Subunits]], then that is exported to cytoplasm for final assembly.==

Most cells have a nucleus, but can have two or none.

DNA is condensed to fit in a nucleus, the long strand is wrapped around repeating units of histones. The compact version of DNA is [[Histones]].

[[Nucleosomes]] are a bundle of 8 histones with DNA.
==[[Chromosomes]] are condensed chromatin and is visible for division.==

[[Cytoplasm]] is the inside of a cell, it refers to the the [[Cytosol]] aqueous solution and what's inside of it.

[[Ribosomes]] are non-membrane bound organelles and found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, they make proteins. They are essential. They are made of two sub units, rRNA and protein.

They are larger in eukaryotes than prokaryotes.

They can either be free floating or bound to rough ER.

[[Endoplasmic Reticulum]] "is a network of interconnected membranes with flattened areas known as [[Cisternae]]" It is subdivided into the rough and smooth ER.

[[Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum]] makes and modifies proteins **before exportation**, it's studded with ribosomes. Keynote is that it can modify the protein like adding glycoproteins.

==[[Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum]] makes lipids and steroid hormones for exporting. The SER in liver cells breaks down toxins, drugs, and toxic by-products. SER's can be specialized in muscle cells and are called [[Sarcoplasmic Reticulum]] that stores and releases calcium ions.==

[[Golgi Apparatus]] is a series of flattened membrane sacs, [[Cisternae]]. It sorts, modifies, and transport proteins. It can also produce [[Lysosomes]] and [[Transport Lipids]]. It has two 'sides', the [[Trans Golgi]] and [[Cis Golgi]]. This is analogous to configurations to chem configurations, cis is referring to the side relative to the ER.

Post Translational protein modification only happens in the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum and Golgi Apparatus.

### 3.4 Cell Digestion and Assorted Structures

Digestion is considered to be the process of breaking down substances. There ==are specialized organelles that do so: [[Lysosomes]], [[Peroxisome]], and [[Vacuoles]].==

==The [[Golgi Apparatus]] can make [[Lysosomes]], they are membrane bound [[Vesicles]] filled with [[Enzymes]]. Lysosomes are involved with [[Apoptosis]], [[Autophagy]], nutrient break down, organelle, and destruction of pathogens.==

[[Vesicles]] are a common word, and lysosomes and peroxisomes are types of vesicles.

==[[Peroxisome]] are a type of [[Vesicles]] that produce hydrogen peroxide and breaks down toxic substances, fatty acids, and hydrogen peroxide using [[Catalases]].== 

[[Vacuoles]] are also a type of [[Vesicles]], and have different specializations. [[Transport Vacuoles]], [[Food Vacuoles]], [[Central Vacuoles]], [[Contractile Vacuoles]]. Its functions revolves around transportation, and their names imply what they do, (kinda)

==[[Cytoskeleton]] is a network of tubules and filaments in [[Cytosol]]. The primary functions are maintaining shape, providing support, movement of components, motility, and anchoring stuff.==

==Three main components are: [[Microfilaments]], [[Intermediate Filaments]], and [[Microtubules]].==

==[[Microtubules Organizing Centers]] arrange microtubule structures within cells.==
==[[Centrosomes]] are two [[Centrioles]] that play a role of forming spindle fibers during cell division.==

[[Microvilli]] are finger like projects that can be found in digestive tract tissue and it's function is to create more surface area ==to allow digestive system to absorb more nutrients==

### 3.5 Energy Production and Endosymbiotic

[[Mitochondria]] produce atp via cellular respiration. **It is a double membrane bound organelle and breaks down fatty acids.**

[[Cristae]], different from [[Cisternae]], is a large surface area found in the inner membrane.

Cells that need need energy have more mitochondria.

[[Chloroplasts]] is used in photosynthesis to make sugar.

[[Endosymbiont Theory]] suggest that energy producing cells were a different cell that ended up working with a different cell until they started becoming one unit. Mitochondria have their own circular dna, have similar size to prokaryotic cells, performs binary fission, and contains prokaryotic like ribosomes.

**[[Mitochondria]] have similar character of [[Prokaryotes]].**

### ==3.6 Membrane Proteins==

Types of proteins that can be found in the [[Plasma Membranes]] include [[Peripheral Proteins]] and [[Integral Proteins]]. 

[[Peripheral Proteins]] are on the surface of a cell, and are held by IMF and hydrogen bonds. 

If an integral protein extends through the entire membrane, they are considered [[Transmembrane Proteins]] 

==They are categorized by function, [[Transport Proteins]], [[Channel Proteins]], [[Carrier Proteins]], [[Receptor Proteins]], [[Glycoproteins]], [[Enzymes]], [[Adhesion Proteins]]== 

[[Transport Proteins]] transport substances materials through the membrane
[[Channel Proteins]] have different categories specialized for target. It can include [[Ion Channels]] where it transports [[Ions]] ==**but it has three major different mechanisms of doing so**==
==Ion channels can be [[Voltage gated channels]], [[Mechanically gated ion channels]], or [[Ligand-Gated Ion Channels]]==

==[[Voltage gated channels]] are reliant on membrane potential==
==[[Mechanically gated ion channels]] based on physical senses, pressure, vibration, and temperature==
==[[Ligand-Gated Ion Channels]] is based on ligand ineraction.==

[[Transport Proteins]] can also be [[Carrier Proteins]], it changes shape to let molecules through.

[[Receptor Proteins]] This is really just a sensor and triggers when a hormone or other molecule attaches.

[[Glycoproteins]] are just id tags made of carbohydrates, it can also function as a receptor.
[[Enzymes]] are catalysts for reactions.
[[Adhesion Proteins]] a here the cell to other cells or proteins

Cell junctions can include [[Tight Junctions]], [[Adherens Junctions]], and [[Gap Junctions]].
It also includes [[Desmosome]], [[Hemidesmosomes]].

==[[Adherens Junctions]] allows for organization into tissues.==
[[Desmosome]] are stronger adherens junctions, but found in tissues prone to mechanical stress.
[[Hemidesmosomes]] attach cells to extracellular matrix.
[[Gap Junctions]] allow for communications and ion/small molecules flow.

[[Basement Membrane]] is part of extracellular matrix that anchors cells.
[[Cell Orientation]] is the terminology for which parts of cell is referred to, apical is outer top, basal is bottom, lateral is sides.

### 3.7 Cell Transport

[[Passive Transport]] is the movement of substances across a membrane from high or lower concentration. I think this refers to [[Diffusion]] and [[Osmosis]]. Passive indicates that it doesn't require power.

[[Simple Diffusion]] doesn't use anything extra like proteins to move.
[[Facilitated Diffusion]] uses proteins to move it across.

[[Active Transport]] requires ATP, [[Primary Active Transport]] uses ATP directly to get a substance to move against a concentration gradient.
[[Secondary Active Transport]] uses energy from different source, [[Antiporters]] and [[Symporters]] refers to the direction of movement of secondary active transport.

[[Endocytosis]] is a transport mechanism that brings extracellular substances in. It has different types that include [[Phagocytosis]], [[Pinocytosis]], and [[Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis]]

[[Exocytosis]] is the opposite.

[[Diffusion]] is the movement of [[Solutes]] from high to lower concentration 
[[Osmosis]] is the movement of solvent from lower to higher concentration
Cells respond to the type of solution they are in, [[Hypotonic]], [[Isotonic]], and [[Hypertonic]].
[[Hypotonic]] means that the solvent does not have much solute, so it would like to move to the higher concentrations, this leads to the [[Lysis]] of cells.

This behavior doesn't really happen in plants because of their different composition in cells, the cell walls allow for withstanding those conditions.

### 3.8 Outer Cell and Intracellular Transport

[[Cell Walls]] are not present in anima cells but are present in plant, fungi, bacteria, and Archea. 
[[Gram-Negative Bacteria]] refers to the presence of [[Peptidoglycan]], where the lack of it stains pink and purple for non lacking.

[[Glycocalyx]] is a carbohydrate coat that covers outer surface of animal and bacterial cells.

[[Extracellular Matrix]] is a network of structural proteins, adhesion proteins, and polysaccharides in areas between animal cells. The main function is structural support, adhesion, and signalling.

Five major components include glycoproteins, proteoglycans, collagen, fibronectin, and integrin.  Collagen is the key feature 

Intracellular transport is accomplished with microtubules and motor proteins. 
Motor proteins include [[Kinesin]] and [[Dynein]]
[[Cyclosis]]  is streaming movement of cytoplasm.

# Biothermodynamics

### 4.1 Introduction to Metabolism and ATP

[[Biological Thermodynamics]] is the transfer of energy between and within living organisms
[[Kinetic Energy]] is any energy involving movement
[[Potential Energy]] energy that could be done, this can be achieved by location of object or stored in bonds, this is mostly the ability to do work without doing it yet.
Biothermodynamic reactions are categorized as [[Exergonic Reactions|Exergonic]] or [[Endergonic Reactions|Endergonic]]
[[Exergonic Reactions]] are classified as [[Spontaneity|Spontaneous]] reactions, where the G value is negative.
[[Endergonic Reactions|Endergonic]] means that they take in energy to proceed a [[Spontaneity|Nonspontaneous]] reaction where the G value is higher.

[[Gibbs Free Energy Change]] 

[[Adenosine Triphosphate]] is the chemical form of stored energy. The bonds between the phosphate groups are source of energy, and its released when broken. [[Hydrolysis]] of ATP is spontaneous, its easier to break things than form things.

[[Cell Metabolism]] is defined as the sum of all chemical reactions in a cell, (catabolism + anabolism + energy transfer)

[[Catabolism]] is the breakdown of complex molecules, and releasing energy. 
[[Anabolism]] is the synthesis of complex molecules and requires energy.

[[Laws of Thermodynamics]] states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, entropy of closed systems must increase or remain constant, entropy decreases when a system reaches [[Absolute Zero]].

### 4.2 Enzymes

[[Catalysts]] are anything that lowers the activation energy of reaction without being consumed. This does not make reactions faster. [[Enzymes]] are biological catalysts. 

[[Substrates]] are molecules that [[Enzymes]] act on, and or bind to.
[[Active Sites]] are where substrates bind to, and the shape of the site determines what binds to it.
[[Induced Fit]] is where an enzyme's active site molds to bind the substrate more tightly
[[Lock and Key Fit]] is disproved

[[Cofactors]] are non-proteins that assists the function of enzymes. They can be organic or non organic. 

[[Coenzymes]] are a type of organic cofactors that covalently bond to enzymes.
[[Cosubstrates]] bind reversibly to enzymes.
[[Inorganic Cofactors]] are metal ions such as Fe2+ and Mg2+

The process of enzyme function is as follows:

1. Substrates bind to the active site
2. Enzyme catalyzes conversion of substrates into products
3. Enzymes released them then attach to another substrate

Important information includes that each enzyme are highly specific, G value doesnt change, and are usually proteins except ribozymes.

[[Ribozymes]] are [[Ribonucleic Acids|RNA]] Molecules with enzymatic function

[[Zymogens]] is an inactive precursor form of an enzyme. It starts changing after cleave or activation. [[Pepsinogen]] activates in the presence of stomach acid.

### 4.3 Enzyme Efficiency and Regulation

Acidity affects enzyme activity, any extreme pH or temperature changes [[Denaturation|Denatures]] proteins. Higher temperatures do increase [[Enzymes]] activity, until a certain point where they might just denature.

There are different levels of enzyme regulation:

Genes that produce enzymes can be activated or disabled like the case of Lac operon.
[[Enzyme Regulation]] can also be [[Physical Enzyme Regulation]] where vesicles hold them until needed
[[Enzyme Regulation]] can be affected by chemical modification
[[Feedback Inhibition]] can either be negative or not, and the product of a reaction inhibits the process, and this is common in homeostasis.

### 4.4 Enzyme Kinetics

[[Enzyme Kinetics]] is the rate of reaction for [[Enzymes]]

$V_{max}$ is the maximum rate of reaction
[[Michaelis Menten Constant]] is the concentration of substrate at half Vmax
Small Km is high binding affinity
Large Km is a low binding affinity

[[Inhibitory Regulation]] includes [[Competitive Inhibitors]], [[Noncompetitive Inhibitors]], and [[Allosteric Regulation]].

[[Competitive Inhibitors]] "inhibitor reversibly binds to active site", but can be overcome with increased substrate concentration.
[[Noncompetitive Inhibitors]] bind to different parts of the enzyme and changes the active site, it is a form of [[Allosteric Regulation]].
[[Allosteric Inhibition]] is a type of inhibitory regulation were the inhibitor binds to the [[Regulatory Sites|Allosteric Sites]] of enzyme and induces the inactive form.

[[Cooperativity]] is the binding of one substrate to increase or change the affinity to bind to more substrates.
[[Negative Cooperativity]] successive substrates make it harder for additional ones to bind.

### Practice

**How are non-spontaneous reactions driven forward in biological systems?**
[[Reaction Coupling]] occurs when [[Spontaneity|Nonspontaneous]] reactions are coupled to [[Exergonic Reactions|Exergonic]] Reactions, and the overall G value becomes negative.

**What is the main way that body maintains homeostasis?**
[[Negative Feedback]] is the main method for maintaining homeostasis where the end product inhibits the enzyme that made it. This can bind to the [[Regulatory Sites|Allosteric Sites]] of the enzyme.

**Which of the following is a biological example of a positive feedback loop?**
Labor Contractions During Birth.
[[Positive Feedback]] occurs when products of reaction triggers more production. Positive word indicates additional formation.

## 4.5 Temperature Coefficient Q10

How fast does a reaction proceed when temp is increased by 10?
$Q_{10}=\left( \frac{K_{2}}{K_{1}} \right)^{10/T_{2}-T_{1}}$
$Q_{10}=\left( \frac{K_{2}}{K_{1}} \right)$ when working with temperatures of 10.

# 4.6 Enzyme Nomenclature

Anything that ends with -ase is a enzyme protein
[[Kinases]] and [[Phosphatase]] are main
Kinase transfer ATp
Phopshate removes phosphate
[[Transferase]] tranasfers functional groups
[[Hydrolase]] breaks shit down
Tyrypsin, Pepsin, and chymotrypsin are odd balls that are peptidases
[[Synthase]] makes stuff
[[Ligases]] liagtes or seals things together
[[Endonuclease]] and [[Exonucleases]] breaks either inline or on 3' or 5' end.


# Cellular Respiration

### 5.1 Mitochondria Anatomy

[[Cellular Respiration]] is a combination of aerobic and anaerobic catabolic pathways for cells to utilized to break down organic compounds into ATP.

[[Cellular Respiration]] is the conversion of [[Organic Molecules]] into [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]].

[[Aerobic Cellular Respiration]] of [[Glucose]] consists of three steps:
1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. [[Citric Acid Cycle]]
3. [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]] and [[Electron Transport Chains]]

[[Mitochondria]], the powerhouse of the cell, is where [[Aerobic Cellular Respiration]] occurs in [[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] cells. More mitochondria mean more energy, means the cell probably does a lot of work. 

They contain their own Circular DNA that can replicate by itself
Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherite

Overall reaction of cellular respiration is

$$\ce{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + O_{2} -> 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + Energy }$$

Cellular respiration is oxidative and exergonic, indicating there is a change of oxidation states in glucose **and** the reaction is spontaneous.

[[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] can be produced in two ways: [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]] and [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]].

[[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]], as the name may imply, a phosphate group is transferred to an ADP from an Enzyme to make the ATP.

[[Oxidative Phosphorylation]] produces ATP using electrons from electron transport chain.

### 5.2 Glycolysis

[[Glycolysis]] reaction can be seen as the following:

$\ce{ Glu + 2NAD+ + 2ADP -> 2Pyruvate +2ATP +2NADH +2P_{i} + 2H_{2}O }$

[[Glycolysis]] is an [[Anaerobic Respiration]] that breaks down glucose into two [[Pyruvate]]. It produces ATP in the process via [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]].

There are two distinct phases
1. Energy investment phase where 2 ATP is invested
2. Energy Payoff phase where it produces 4 ATP and 2 NADH
[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] is an electron carrier that transport high energy to [[Electron Transport Chains]]
[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] needs to be available to glycolysis to proceed and NADH to be made.

[[Pyruvate]] has two possible paths: 
1. Respiratory path were oxygen is present indicating the TCA and ETC are active
2. Non-respiratory path where oxygen is absent, [[Fermentation]]

### 5.3 Citric Acid Cycle

[[Pyruvate Decarboxylation]], in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate gets converted into [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]] in the [[Mitochondrial Matrix]]

For each molecule of glucose:

$\ce{ 2Pyruvate -> 2{Acetyl CoA} + 2 NADH +2CO_{2} }$

The main reactant that starts in the [[Citric Acid Cycle]] is [[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]]. The citric acid cycle produces ATP via [[Substrate-Level Phosphorylation]].

[[Acetyl Coenzyme A|Acetyl CoA]] from the [[Pyruvate]] decarboxylation merges with [[Oxaloacetate]] to make [[Citrate]] and goes through 7 more steps.

The cycle happens twice for each glucose molecule.
Each cycle produces 1 ATP, 3 NADH, and 1 FADH2.

NADH and FADH2 are high energy electron carriers. During the cycle they are reduced by gaining electrons.

### 5.4 Electron Transport Chain

[[Electron Transport Chains]] are series of proteins that pass high energy electrons to each other.
[[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]] and [[Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide|FADH2]] lose their hydrogens and electrons.

When passing through the electron transport chain, protons are pumped from mitochondrial matrix into intermembrane space

The protons are establishing the [[Electrochemical Gradient]] across the membrane
The final step of ETC is the transfer of electrons to O2 then formation of water.

[[ATP Synthase]] makes ATP from ADP with [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]
[[Proton-Motive Force]] is energy produced by movement of protons
[[Chemiosmosis]] is movement of ions down a concentration gradient

### 5.5 Anerobic Respiration

[[Anaerobic Respiration]] and [[Fermentation]] are two different things.
[[Anaerobic Respiration]] is cellular respiration with other molecules than oxygen as final electron acceptor, such as SO4 2-, S, etc.

[[Fermentation]] is the recycling of NADH into NAD+ with pyruvate

Types of fermentation includes [[Alcohol Fermentation]] that happens with yeast and some bacteria.
[[Lactic Acid Fermentation]] that happens in human muscle cells, fungi, and bacteria.

### 5.6 Intro to Alternate Energy Sources

[[Glucose]] is the preferred cellular energy source, but other molecules can be used if glucose is absent

### 5.7 Alternative Energy Sources

[[Glycogenesis]]: body stores extra glucose as glycogen by linking glucose molecules together, it is stored in liver and muscles. It costs ATP to make glucose into Glucose 6 Phosphate
[[Glycogenolysis]] is breakdown of glycogen into glucose for energy.
[[Gluconeogenesis]] is the creation of glucose from non-carbohydrate molecules.
[[Glycolysis]] is the break down of glucose to make pyruvate
[[Carbohydrate Metabolism]] is regulated with [[Insulin]] when blood glucose is high, or [[Glucagon]] when blood glucose is low. 

### 5.8 Alternative Energy Sources (Lipids)

[[Lipolysis]] is the break down of [[Fats|Triglycerides]] into glycerol and 3 fatty acid chains
[[Lipase]] splits glycerol and fatty acids apart
[[Beta Oxidation]] cuts carbons away from fatty acid change to produce Acetyl Coa, and NADH, and FADH2
The brain likes to use glucose, but will resort to ketones from fatty acids when needed
### 5.9 Alternative Energy Sources (Proteins)

Proteins are the least preferred, but the amino acids are broken down then enter cellular respiration pathway

[[Oxidative Deamination]] is the removal of the amino group to make other intermediates, and it occurs in the liver.

Energy comes from almost all the macromolecules except for nucleic acid.

### Question Bank Practice

**Which of the following is correctly associated with NAD+?**
Selected: High Energy Molecule
Correct: [[Coenzymes]], [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NAD+]] is a [[Coenzymes]] and a low energy version of [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]]. Higher energy is associated with more electrons, if it is formally positive it's missing electrons. 

**Cellular respiration is a(n) ________.**
~~Reductive Process~~
[[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidative]] Process because [[Glucose]] is loosing electrons. [[Oxidation Reduction Reactions|Oxidation]] is the loss of electrons.

**Which of the following steps acts as a regulator for the rate of glycolysis?**
~~Acetyl Coenzyme A~~
[[Phosphofructokinase]] [[Phosphorylation]] converts Fructose 6-Phosphate to Fructose 1,6-Bisphosphate. PFK is negatively regulated by high levels of ATP

**Where does eukaryotic glycolysis occur?**
~~Inner mitochondrial matrix~~
I guessed there
[[Glycolysis]] occurs in the [[Cytoplasm]] to make the precursor [[Pyruvate]] which will be transported to the mitochondrial matrix.

**Inner mitochondrial matrix**
~~A. 2 NADH, 4 ATP, 1 pyruvate~~
The products of [[Glycolysis]] is 2 [[Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide|NADH]], 2 [[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]], and 2 [[Pyruvate]]

### 6.1 Chloroplast Anatomy


# 3 Cells and Organelles

## 3.1 Cell Theory

A Cell is a collection of organelles, which are made up of macromolecules
Plant cells looked like small rooms
==Three tenets of cell theory is that organisms are made of one or more cells, cells are basic units of structure and organization in organisms, and the come from existing cells.==
Modern version adds more tenets, activity of organisms depend on total activity of independent cells, flow of energy occurs within cells, Cells pass and carry hereditary information such as DNA, all cells have similar composition in same species.
Some organisms are unicellular or multicellular.
Cells are bound with a plasma membrane
Cells contain DNA 
All ribosomes are there to make proteins
Two cells major cells are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.
[[Prokaryotes|Prokaryotic]] Cells do not have membrane bound nucleus or organelles,
[[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] cells do.

## 3.2 Cell Membrane & Permeability

The plasma membrane protects cells from its environment
It is made of a phospholipid bilayer
The bilayer is made of two layers of phsopliibid molecules, it makes up majority of the memabrne.
It is made of the macromolecule lipid of phospolipid.
The head is hydrophilic phosphate, fatty acid is hydrophobic
The membrane is selectively permeable
It depends on charge on size
The Fluid Mosaic Model is a concept that membrane is made of many different parts, and the fluid describes that the component are constantly moving
==[[Cholesterols]] are responsible for regulating [[Membranes]] fluidity.== It holds the membrane together at high temperatures, and fluid at lower temperatures.
Rough ER and Smooth Er
Rough ER has many ribsomes and it does post translation 
Smooth ER has no er, it makes lipids and steroids hormones
Breaks down toxins and drugs
Gologi Apparatus modifiy and package protiens, it makes lysosomes, then transports in vesicles
It does not make proteins
## ==3.3 Organelles & Cell Structures==

Eukaryotic Cell Organelles
Organelle is the functional units of cells, the most important one are: nucleus which contains DNA. Which is made of a nuclear envelope, lamina which is support, and nucleolus.
Most cells have a single nuclus
Nucleolus is a site for RNA, and it assembiles ribosomes.
DNA is packaged into the nucleus, chromatins are the general pakcing for dna.
DNa is warpped around histone bundled in nucleosomes
Chromosomes man
Cytosol and Cytoplasm
Cytosol is the aqeous substance
Cytoplasm is everything that the includes all the cytosol that holds
Ribosomes synthesize proteins
Each are made in rRNA and Protein
==[[Histones]] are [[Proteins]] that [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] wraps around, then the complex structure is a [[Nucleosomes]].==
[[Ribosomes]] are found in both [[Prokaryotes]] and [[Eukarya|Eukaryotes]]
==[[Eukarya|Eukaryotic]] ribosomal subuts are 60s and 40s which make 80s==
==Prokaryotic subnits are 50 and 30s and make 70s==
==S is svedberg units==
==The [[Cis Golgi]] is closes to the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum|ER]]==
==Smooth ER makes lipids, steroids, and detoxifying cells==
## ==3.4 Cell Digestion & Assorted Structures==

Cells breakdown stuff frequently
[[Lysosomes]] are membrane bound and filled with digest enzymes
It can perform apoptosis, autophagy, and break down nutrients 
Peroxisomes can make h2o2 to break down fatty acids and proteins
Vauoles have specialized functions liek transport to moe materials
Food vacuoles to transport foods
central vaculols are plant specialized
Contractile cells collect and pump water excess
Cytoskeletons maintains shape and support of cells
Its like a highway
Allows cells to move
It can anchor proteins
Its made of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules
 Microtubules make up cilia, falgella, and centrioles
 Microvilli are membrane projects from actin core, it increases surface area of cells
 Centrioles do not have membranes, they are organizing centers.
## 3.5 Energy Production & Endosymbiotic Theory

Mitochondria is double layered organelle
They have their own dna and ribosomes
They create ATP and is place for beta-oxidation
Chloroplasts are sites for syntheis that uses light energy to make sugar
It absorbs red and blue light and reflects green
[[Endosymbiont Theory]] Mitrochondria and chloroplast used to be independe prokaryotes
Then they eventally got together
Evidence is the circular dna, divde via binary fission, then contains other structures similar to bactera
Animal and Plant cells
Plants have cell walls
Animal cells have centrioles
Plastids 
Storage vacuoles have 
Cell walls

## ==3.6 Membrane Proteins==

Proteins found in membrane, categorized by position
Peripheral Protein, they on surface and held with hydrogen bonds
Inetegral are integrated into membrane, if it goes all they way it is a transmembrane protein 
They are mostly hydrophic and needs something like detergent to break it out
Transport Proteins lets substances move through the membrane
Channel Proteins can include ion channels that allow [[Ions]] to pass through the membrane
Some ion channels are either voltage or mechanically gated, or even ligand gated
Carrier proteins are for transport of maybe large ones?
Receptor proteins 
Glycoproteins have carbs attached, its used for signalling or recogniztions and adhesion
Enzymes can be embedded into it
Junctions can connect cells to another cell
Tight junctions really lock in the cells together
They are common in the blood brain barrier
Adherens Junctions 
[[Gap Junctions]] Make tunnels between cells, it allows molecules or ions to be transported 
Celll ORientation
Apical is outward side of cell like cilia are on it
Lateral surface is side of cell
Basal side is the bottom

## 3.7 Cell Transport

[[Passive Transport]] and [[Active Transport]], named based on if energy is required to perform action.
[[Adenosine Triphosphate|ATP]] is the main source of work.
[[Active Transport]] helps move substances away from where they naturally want to chill.
[[Passive Transport]] includes [[Simple Diffusion]] and [[Facilitated Diffusion]]
Facilitated diffusion is helped with a transmembrane transport protein
[[Active Transport]] requires transport proteins
[[Secondary Active Transport]] doesn't use ATP, but uses existing natural movement of things like ions. But it can be either same or anti way directions.
[[Exocytosis]] can be triggered with increase of Ca Ions.
[[Endocytosis]] has three different formats: [[Phagocytosis]] which is like eating substances, [[Pinocytosis]] is like drinking and is indiscriminate. [[Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis]] which [[Clathrin Coated Pits]].
[[Diffusion]] and [[Osmosis]] refers to solutes or solvents travelling through semi permeable membranes.

Osmosis in animal cells.
Hypo, Hyper, and iso refer to surrounding solution concentration.
Hypotonic solutions bursts cells.
Solution types always refer to osmosis.

Plant cells is differenet beacuse of their cell walls
Hypotonic solutions leads to turgidity 
Isotonic Soluions lead to flaccidness 
Hypertonic leads to 

## 3.8 Outer Cell and Intracellular Movement

Cell walls are extra layers found in bacteria, plants, fungi, and protists.
Bacteria uses peptidoglycan
Plan uses cellulose
Fungi uses chitin
Gram negtaive have lipopolysaccharides  nad release toxics when dead
Gylcocalyx is found on inside of blood vessels 
Extracellular Matrix can be made of proteins, and polysccharides

# 17 Nervous System

## 17.1 Neuron Structure

Functional Units of nervous system is the Neuron
Dendrites of recievers of signals
Axon hillock is where ap are initiated
Axons transduce or 'send' or pull away
Mylein sheat moves faster acts like an insulator and polarize small sections
Sultatory conductions makes it faster
Thicker neurons move signals faster
Olgodendrocyrtes a$e myeline sheat in \ce{ ntral nervous system
Schwann cells
Microglia are assocated with immune
Ependymal cells and nourisment
[[Satellite Cells]] is a [[Glial Cells]] that provides nutrients and support to peripheral nervous system
[[Nodes of Ranvier]] are [[Unmyelinated]] sections of [[Axons]] that are involved with [[Saltatory Conduction]] and it depolarizes the unmyelinated area 

## 17.2 Action Potentials

Actional potentials are the impulses
Types of channels related to acational potentials are [[Voltage gated channels]], [[Ligand-Gated Ion Channels]], and [[Mechanically gated ion channels]]
Inside cells is more negative
Outside contains more cations
Graded potential is and change in AP
Na channels open in reposice to a stim

3 Na+ gets transported out of a neuron and 2 K+ are transported in to the neuron with Na+K+ ATPase

Refractory Period are when there is no response to stimuli
Includes Absolute and Relative
When a cell is in a resting state, it is [[Polarized]] and Unstimulated, concentration of posivite charges are outside the cells, and the interior is mostly negatively charged proteins

If a cell ran out of ATP thenre there would be a high sodium+ concentration, and low K+ concentration

## 17.3 Synaptic Transmission

Two types of transmission, electrical and chemical
Electrical uses gap junctions
Chemical Tranmissions uses neurotransmetters and vesicelse ot and reicekes
Forbed between adjacent signals transducing axons and receiving cells
[[Synaptic Clefts]] are where chemical transmissions occur
Action potential needs to reach the synaptic region
Cannels need to be activaed in the Presynaptic terminical
Ca+ causes presynmaptic neuro to release neurotranmsister
Nueortranmisster will bind to receptors on the post synamtpic cell
Posy synaptic membrane is exicted or inhibitied
NT is degraded, recylced, or diffused away

Excitator Membmebrae depolarizes by opening Na+ gated ions
Inhibitor is the obssite
Ca+ is the main ion that is involved with tranmission

## 17.4 Neurotransmitters

Acetylcholine is very important and released at junctions for muscle contractions and causes a excitatory response
[[Acetylcholinesterase]] is in the Post Synaptic Membrane, it hydrolyzes acetylcholine to end signal transmission
[[Glutamate]] is the most common, it causes depolarization
[[GABA]] is inhibitory NT
Glycine inhibits
Aminio Acid Derivatives 
Epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin
Nitric Oxide, causes relaxation of smooth muscles

# 18 Muscular System

## 18.1 Overview and Skeletal Muscle Structures

Skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle
Skeletal muscles are striated, the banded and parallel look
They are multinucleated
Myoblasts combine with satellite cells to make the the skeletabl muscles
Epimysium connects to tendons
Fasciles are the next small unit
then within is the fibers
Muscle fibers are the actual cells
Sarcolemma is the membrane of muscle stuff
Myofibrils are the cellular structures of the muscle fiber
Sarcomeres
Sarcoplasmic Reticulum 
Mitochondria
T-tubules
Sarcoplasm 
Sarcolemma

Neuromuscular Interaction

# 22 Endocrine System

## 22.1 Hormones & Signaling

Series of glands and organs that produce and secrete hormones
Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through blood and act on specific targets
Vascular systems allow hormones to signal targets for long periods of times
It can affect almost every cell in the body
Types of signalling include endroine which hromones travel through blood
Exocrine secertes substances through ducts
Paracine is something like neurotransmitters at a synaptic cleft
Autocrine binds receptors on same cells

Three types of hormones such as [[Peptide Hormones]], [[Steroid Hormones]], and [[Tyrosine]]

## 22.2 Peptide Hormones and Secondary Messengers

[[Peptide Hormones]] are basically proteins and made in Rough ER
These bind to surface receptors and DO NOT go into the cell
These are [[Hydrophilic]] and large so they cannot diffuse through membranes
These can open some channels or other things
This does a cascade effect with [[Secondary Messengers]], cAMP IP3 DAG and Calcium
[[cyclic AMP|cAMP]], [[Inositol Trisphosphate]], [[DAG]], [[Calcium]]
[[Ligands]] are what binds to receptors which has a specific [[G-Protein]], then the protein makes secondary messangers to activate signaling
It can respond wiht transcriptional factors, gene activation etc..
[[cyclic AMP|cAMP]] activates Adenylyl cyclase ends with phosporyliation
IP3 follows the same mechanism activates [[Phospholipase C]] that cuts [[PIP2]] into [[DAG]] and something
IP3 goes into the cytoplasm to ineteract with ER etc.
[[DAG]] activates [[Protein Kinase C]] and triggars another cellular pathway
[[Peptide Hormones]] have a lot examples and originate from specific glands or organs.

[[Growth Factors]] also bind to surface receptors, and are not considered peptide hormones
[[Peptide Hormones]] are [[Synthesis Reactions|Synthesized]] in the [[Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
[[Inositol Trisphosphate]] is involved with the release of Calcium
[[Anterior Pituitary Gland]] exclusively makes [[Peptide Hormones]]

## 22.3 Steroid & Amine Derivative Hormones

[[Steroid Hormones]] are always made in sER from cholesterol and can pass through cell membranes ecause they are hydrophhoic
Direct stimulation where hormone receptor complexes are formed, and it can bine to activate DNA and alter gene expression
[[Adrenal Cortex]] make cortisol and aldosterone
[[Amino Acid Derivative Hormones]] are mostly derived from [[Tyrosine]]
Broadly classified as [[Thyroid Hormones]] an [[Catecholamines]]
[[Catecholamines]] cannot diffuse through membranes
[[Thyroid Hormones]] include $\ce{ T_{3} }$ and $\ce{ T_{4} }$  it increases transcriptions 
[[Catecholamines]] include [[Epinephrine]] and [[Norepinephrine]] and are hydrophilic which bind to surface receptors, and it acts as secondary messengars

[[Norepinephrine]] IS NOT A STEROID, IT IS A AMINO ACID DERIVATIVE

## 22.4 Homeostasis

Main mechanisms of [[Homeostasis]] are [[Feedback Loops]]
[[Hormones]] are the main components in the loops
The loops are either [[Positive Feedback]] or [[Negative Feedback]]
[[Negative Feedback]] is the primary way to maintain homeostasis where the production stops when a threshold is met.
Loops can be short or long

[[Positive Feedback]] includes breast feeding where the feeding stimulates the production
They build up and stop at certain point
[[Negative Feedback]] can include something like a high glucose level, then detected by insulin secreting cells of pancreas
[[Calcitonin]] is released when blood calcium levels are too high to reduce it.

## 22.5 Endocrine Organs Part 1

Major Endocrine Organs include: Pineal gland, Hypothalamus, Pituitary Gland, Thyroid, Parathyroid, Thymus, Adrenal Gland

[[Hypothalamus]] maintains [[Homeostasis]] and checks for internal and external environment
It links [[Endocrine Systems]] and [[Nervous System]]
The [[Pituitary Stalk]] connects both nervous and endocrine system
[[Hypothalamus]] makes [[Antidiuretic Hormone]] and [[Oxytocin]] and stories in posterior place
[[GnRH]] stimulates to make FSH LH
CRH triggers to rlease ACTH
[[Hypothalamus]] has a vascular connection and releases [[Hypophyseal Portal Veins]] to transport hormone to [[Anterior Pituitary Gland]]
The posterior putiary connection is completely different
Hyptohalmus makes ADH and Oxytocin and puts it in the posterior pituitary 
Posterior pituitiary is storage but also outputs via neuronal connection
[[Anterior Pituitary Gland]] hormones can be described as [[Tropic Hormones]] or [[Nontropic Hormones]] 
[[Nontropic Hormones]] act on non-endocrine tissue and include [[Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone]], [[Prolactin]], and [[Growth Hormone]]
[[Tropic Hormone]] Include [[TSH]], [[ACTH]], [[FSH]], [[LH]]
[[Posterior Pituitary Gland]] includes [[Antidiuretic Hormone]] to regular water levels in body is inhibited drinking coffee and alchol
[[Oxytocin]] secerted during child birth and milk ejection, it has love hormone
[[Pineal Gland]] makes [[Melatonin]] and it is a [[Tryptophan]] derivative

[[Nontropic Hormones]] directly affect non-endocrine [[Tissues]].
[[Antidiuretic Hormone]] and [[Oxytocin]] are produced in the [[Hypothalamus]] and then travel to the [[Posterior Pituitary Gland]] via [[Neurons]], where as if it went to the [[Anterior Pituitary Gland]] it would travel via vascular system.

[[Growth Hormone]] is a [[Nontropic Hormones]] that directly stimulates growth of bones and muscle.
[[Prolactin]] 

## 22.6 Endocrine Organs Part 2

[[Thyroid Gland]] is anterior to [[Trachea]] and makes T3, T4, and calitonin
It is responsible for increasing body metabolism, and increases heart rate.
[[Calcitonin]] is a [[Peptide Hormones]].
T3 and T4 are [[Amino Acid Derivative Hormones]]
[[Calcitonin]] inhibits osteoclast activity
Ton for Tones down blood calcium
[[Iodine]] is essential for making T3 and T4.
[[Follicles]] surrounds a [[Lumen]]
Disorders include [[Hyperthyroidism]] and [[Hypothyroidism]] which indicate excess or under secretion of T3 and T4 which leads to [[Goiters]], the enlargement of the [[Thyroid Gland]]
Lack of Iodine can lead to goiters

[[Parathyroid]] are pea shaped structures
It has [[Peptide Hormones]] and has opposite function of Thyroids
It increases [[Osteoclast]] activity for bone resorption
It activates [[Vitamin D]] to its active form to increase calcium absorption in the gut
It lowers blood phosphate levels via phosphate excretion

[[Thymus]] found in chest, and secretes [[Thymosin]] which makes baby T cells
[[Adrenal Glands]] includes cortex and medulla
Outer and inner parts
It also makes two different types of hormones
[[Adrenal Cortex]] makes [[Steroid Hormones]] like [[Glucocorticoids]] such as [[Cortisol]] and [[Cortisone]]
[[Mineralocorticoids]] affiliated with [[Aldosterone]]
[[Medulla]] makes [[Epinephrine]] and [[Norepinephrine]] which are involved with fight or flight [[Catecholamines]]

[[Hyperthyroidism]] would cause high heart rates because [[T3]] and [[T4]] increase body metabolism and heart rate

## 22.7 Endocrine Organs Part 3

[[Pancreas]] has endo and exocrine functions which excretes digestive enzymes 
It has alpha cells that excrete Glucagon that increase blood glucose levels
It promotes [[Glycogenolysis]] and [[Gluconeogenesis]] in Liver
Beta Cells Make Insulins to reduce blood glucose levels
[[Insulin]] has the opposite functions of [[Glucagon]]
[[Delta Cells]] secrete [[Somatostatin]]
Inhibits [[Insulin]] and [[Glucagon]]
It inhibits Gastro-Intestinal Hormones
It decreases gastric motility
[[Gonads]] include Testes and Ovaries
It is stimulated by [[FSH]] and [[LH]], then they produce [[Steroid Hormones]]
[[Cholesterols]] are the precursor to all sex hormones and steroid hormones
Testes make gametes and hormones
[[Spermatogenesis]]
Testosterone affects libido, bone, muscle mass
Ovaries make eggs and [[Oogenesis]], it reuglars periods, seconadary sex characteris such as hip widening, menstration, pubic hair
[[Progesterone]] regulates menstrual cycle, early state pergnancy
Regulates uterine lining and thickening in the endometrical wall
[[Prostaglandins]] signlaing molecules
Present in semen to stimulate contraction of smooth muscles in uterous to guide spersm
Excite uterus and induce labor
Enhave sensitivity to pain
[[Gastrointestinal Hormones]] made by [[Digestive Tract]], includes [[Gastrin]] is secreted by its target
[[Cholecystokinin]] stimulates releas , pancreasu enzyem release, gastric motili
[[Secretin]] releases bicarboniate from bpearcous to balance chyme
