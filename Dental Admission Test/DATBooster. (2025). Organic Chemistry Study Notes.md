# Chapter 2 IUPAC Nomenclature

## 1 Nomenclature Basics

[[Parent Chain]] is the longest carbon chain present in the molecule, if there is branching present in the molecule then it can sometimes be hard to see the 'longest' chain. The prefix that describes the number of carbons can be seen in the following table.

**Table 1**
*Parent Chain Prefixes*

| n Carbons | Prefix |
| --------- | ------ |
| 1         | meth-  |
| 2         | eth-   |
| 3         | prop-  |
| 4         | but-   |
| 5         | pent-  |
| 6         | hex-   |
| 7         | hept-  |
| 8         | oct-   |
| 9         | non-   |
| 10        | dec-   |
*Note: n = number of carbons*

### Alkane "-ane"

If the [[Hydrocarbons]] are fully saturated, the suffix, -ane, is added to the parent chain. Saturated hydrocarbons do not contain double or triple bonds.

### Alkyl Substituents

[[Alkyl Groups]] are hydrocarbon substituents connected to the [[Parent Chain]]. The main rule is that substituents are always given the lowest number when naming a molecule.

If multiple substituents are present, they they are sorted by alphabetical order, if multiple copies are present they get a prefix too, but slightly different than the parent chain prefixes.

**Table 2**
*Prefixes for multiple substituents*

| n Substituents | Prefix |
| -------------- | ------ |
| 2              | di     |
| 3              | tri    |
| 4              | tetra  |
| 5              | penta  |
| 6              | hexa   |
| 7              | hepta  |

The prefix is not referred to when alphabetically arranging the substituents.

3-ethyl-4-methyl==-==Heptane
==Dashes are not used to separate substituents from parent chain, nor is the parent chain capitalized==

3-ethyl-4-methylheptane

### Halogen Substituents

[[Alkyl Halides]] are any [[Alkanes]] with [[Halogens]] connected to them. Their prefix replaces their endings, -ine, with o.

**Table 3**
*Halogen Substituent Pre-Fixes*

| Halogen  | Prefix  |
| -------- | ------- |
| Fluorine | Fluoro- |
| Chlorine | Chloro- |
| Bromine  | Bromo-  |
| Iodine   | Iodo-   |

## 2 Alkenes and Alkynes

[[Alkenes]] and [[Alkynes]] are any hydrocarbon that contains a double bond or an alkyne in their parent chain. Naming the parent chain prioritizes giving the pi bond the lowest [[Locant]], and the number indicates where the double or triple bond is.

### Alkenes "-ene"

[[Alkenes]] are any molecules with a **carbon-carbon double bond**, and the number indicates where the double bond is. This would exclude double bonds of functional groups such as carbonyls.

The IUPAC name places the locant number right before the -ene.

penta-2-ene.

### Alkynes "-yne"

[[Alkynes]] are any molecules that contain a **carbon-carbon triple bond**.

**Example 2.21:**
What is the IPUAC name of the following molecule?

![[Pasted image 20250301154432.png]]



Non-2-ene
6-propyl
9-fluoro
~~9-Fluoro-6-propylnon-2-ene~~

![[DATBooster. (2025). Organic Chemistry Study Notes 2025-03-01 15.49.27.excalidraw]]

Mistake: Mis-counted the carbon chain, the double bond **must** get the lowest number. **and** literally miscounted the number of carbons of the chain, missed the locant that connects the fluorine to.

dec-1-ene
2-methyl
6-propyl
10-fluoro

10-fluoro-2-methyl-6-propyldec-1-ene

## 3 Cyclic Compounds

Cyclic Alkanes are prefixed with **cyclo**.

![[Pasted image 20250301155550.png]]

cyclohexane
1-chloro
3,4-dimethyl

~~1-chloro-3,4-dimethyl~~cyclohexane

Mistake: Assigned wrong locants **The main rule is that all substituents should have the lowest assigned locant, halogens and alkyl groups are equivalent. 4-chloro-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane is better because they assigned the lowest possible number**

### Spiro Compounds

[[Spiro Compounds]] are two rings connected by one carbon. 
1. Count the numbers of each ring
2. List the the numbers from lowest to highest inside brackets
3. Then the prefix is added before brackets
4. Sum the number of carbons and write the parent chain name after brackets

![[Pasted image 20250301161312.png]]

### Bicyclic Compounds

[[Bicyclic Compounds]] are made of two or more rings linked with a bridgehead. 
1. count number of carbons of each ring excluding bridgehead carbons 
2. List the numbers, separated by '.' in highest to lowest inside brackets
3. Add bicyclo before brackets
4. Count number of all carbons and write the parent chain based off that
This is dumb because the order of from highest to lowest is inverted from spiro compounds.

## 4 Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

In [[IUPAC]] naming there is a functional group priority, and a table. When there are multiple functional group, the highest priority determines suffix and it gets the lowest locant assigned to it.

**Table 4**
*Functional Group Priorities*

| Priority | Functional Group                  |       |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| 1        | Carboxylic Acid                   | -COOH |
| 2        | [[Acid Anhydride]]                |       |
| 3        | Ester                             |       |
| 4        | [[Acid Halide]]                   |       |
| 5        | Amide                             |       |
| 6        | Nitrile                           |       |
| 7        | Aldehyde                          |       |
| 8        | Ketone                            |       |
| 9        | Alcohol                           |       |
| 10       | Amine                             |       |
| 11       | Alkene                            |       |
| 12       | Alkyne                            |       |
| 13       | Alkyl, Halogen, Alkoxy, and Nitro |       |
*Note: From 1 - 6, the functional groups are Carboxylic Acid Derivatives*

### Carboxylic Acid

Naming a carboxylic acid is performed by the following:
1. Find Parent chain containing the carboxylic acid
2. Change the suffix to -oic acid, the carbonyl carbon of the acid is always carbon 1.
3. Then like before, add the other substituents in alphabetical order.
This procedure is the same for all of the derivatives. **The carbonyl locant is always assumed to be locant 1, so it doesn't need to be included in the iupac name**

### Acid Anhydrides

This are less common, but good to know.
1. List each component carboxylic acid in alphabetical order, with out the word acid
2. Insert anhydride in the end
![[Pasted image 20250301164258.png]]

### Esters

The suffix for [[Esters]] are 'oate', the alkyl group bonded to the ester oxygen is listed prior to the parent chain name with -yl.

### Acid Halides

Suffix is -oyl halide.

### Amides

Suffix is amide, the locant for this is N.

### Nitriles

Suffix is Nitrile, and added right after the parent name. 

### Cyclic Carboxylic Acid Derivates

This is important for DAT, Carboxylic acid and carboxamide.

![[Pasted image 20250301164750.png]]

==A. Propyl ethanoate==
==B. 2-Methylbutanenitrile==
C. ~~N-Methyl, 2-ethyl-~~butanamide, **Swap the substituents so that they are in alphabetical order: ethyl then methyl**
D. 4-chloro-==2==-difluoro-Butanoic Acid, **forgot to add the locant for he second fluorine**

## 5 Additional Functional Groups

The next order of priority are [[Aldehydes]] then [[Ketones]], both of which are just [[Carbonyl Groups]] with specific placements. They are not derivatives of [[Carboxylic Acid]].

### Aldehydes

Naming aldehydes are done by the following:
1. Identify the longest parent chain with the highest priority group (remember the following order, any carboxylic acid and its derivative, aldehydes, ketones)
2. Number the chain in away that the functional group gets the lowest number.
3. If the aldehyde is the highest priority, then change the parent chain ending to **-al**. This means that carbonyl carbon is in always 1. Then add the substituents after.
[[Aldehydes]] on a [[Cycloalkane]] is given the suffux **-carbaldehyde** at the end. If there are multiple substituents, the it must be noted that its at locant one.

### Ketones

Do the same thing where the ketone has the lowest number, then change the suffix to **-one**. If the ketone is not the highest priority, then the prefix is **oxo-**.

![[Pasted image 20250301170116.png]]

5-bromo-3-chloropentan==ol== **-ol is the wrong suffix, it should be -al like ALdehyde. -ol are for alcohOLs**

![[Pasted image 20250301170311.png]]


~~1-oxo-~~2-propylcyclopentan~~e~~
**The ketone is the highest priority so it changes the suffix to -1-one, it should not be -oxo.**

### Alcohols

Molecules with the hydroxyl group is an alcohol. Like before, look for the longest parent chain with the **highest priority group***, and number it so that group has the lowest locant if possible. In this case, the suffix should be **-ol**. If the group is not the highest priority, then the prefix is **n-hydroxy where n = locant**

### Amines

[[Amines]] are made up of a nitrogen with three or less hydrogens. Primary amines have one r group, secondary has two r groups, the tertiary has three r groups.

1. Look for longest carbon parent chain with highest priority group
2. Number chain so that the group has the lowest number
3. If the amine is the highest priority, then the suffix is amine with a locant number before it.
4. if its the not the highest, add the amino prefix to it with locant attached
5. If anything is attached to nitrogen, then label the alkyl substituent with locant N

### Ethers

Ethers have oxygens single bonded to two carbon atoms. The naming is same as alkyl groups but with the suffix **-alkoxy**

Example, methyl sticking out of an oxygen is a **locant n-methoxy**

### Nitro Groups

are named by same convention as halogen substituents 

### Sulfur-Containing compounds

[[Thiol]] is a sulfur analog of alcohol. Name it like alcohol with suffix **thiol**, or prefix of **mercapto**.
Sulfides are like Ethers, then names are **alkylthio**
Sulfonic acids are named sulfonic acid, or sulfo when not priority.

![[Pasted image 20250301172109.png]]

A. 5-methylhex **==5-==** en-2-ol
~~B. 1-methyl-2-bromo-1-nitropentane~~
~~C. 1-ethylether-4-fluoropentane~~
D. N-Ethyl-Butan~~e-4-~~amide

## 6 Benzene Derivatives

Benzene goes after the subtitents :P
