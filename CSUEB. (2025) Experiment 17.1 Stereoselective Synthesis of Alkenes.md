[[Aldehydes]] and [[Ketones]] are ideal starting materials for preparing other compounds.
[[Grignard Synthesis]] is a "principle method for making new carbon-carbon bonds"
[[Wittig Synthesis]] involves [[Carbonyl Groups]] and a [[Wittig Reagent]] which has a "resonance-stabilized carbanion"
The primary feature is the conversion of [[Carbonyl Groups]] into a double bond, specifically [[Alkenes]]

# Background

Conversion involves 9-anthraldehyde to trans-9-(2-phenylethenyl)anthracene with 50% aq NaOH and benzyltriphenylphosphonium.

The reacting protons are the alpha protons of benzyl group in benzyltriphenylphosphonium.
NaOH removes one of the alpha protons, then forms a resonance-stabilized [[Ylide]].

The Ylide with its separated charges reacts with the carbonyl and forms a doublebond between them.

The product can be isolated with recrystallization.
